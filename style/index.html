York strolls, Tom Holland and Zendaya's looks have become iconic emblems of couple style, each appearance adding a new chapter to their effortlessly chic love story. Their fashion journey began quietly, with subtle nods to each other's vibe, but has since evolved into a standout aesthetic defined by tasteful coordination and authentic expressions of their unique personalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Zendaya is often seen in high fashion \u2014 thanks to her stylist Law Roach's bold choices for brands like Valentino and Louis Vuitton \u2014 Tom\u2019s laid-back but polished look complements her with just the right dose of cool. Think back to their coordinated spring pastels in 2022: Zendaya in moss green knitwear paired with tailored trousers, while Tom sported a lavender T-shirt, both leaning into a breezy, harmonised style\u200b.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir recent October 2024 outing in New York, however, turned the dial up on their couple fashion game. Attending the launch of Tom\u2019s new non-alcoholic beer brand, Bero, the duo fully embraced autumn\u2019s colour of the moment \u2014 burgundy. This rare twinning moment marks another level in their fashion evolution, showcasing just how seamlessly their styles mesh. Below we take a look at their best, most revered fashion moments through the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Holland and Zendaya's best couple fashion moments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe burgundy look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by The Feature Presentation (@thefeaturepresentation)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the launch event for Bero, Tom Holland's non-alcoholic beverage\u00a0brand, he and Zendaya embodied the art of matching while still flaunting their individual tastes. Zendaya stunned in a rich burgundy leather gown by Louis Vuitton, cinched at the waist and styled with soft waves that matched her new chocolate brown hair\u200b. Her gown\u2019s deep, lustrous tone and bold cut made it a flawless pick for fall, completed with Louboutin heels and understated Bvlgari jewellery. Tom, meanwhile, opted for a more relaxed Prada ensemble, pairing a burgundy knit top with black trousers and white sneakers \u2014 elevating casual with a colour that perfectly mirrored Zendaya\u2019s ensemble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe choice to twin in burgundy may not have been purely coincidental. Tom\u2019s stylist, Crystalle Cox, hinted that his outfit was inspired by the hue of Bero\u2019s \u201cEdge Hill Hazy IPA\u201d flavour, showing just how intentional their looks were for the night\u200b. As they exited the venue hand-in-hand, their coordinated look felt both effortless and planned \u2014 a perfect example of Tom and Zendaya's couple fashion that\u2019s increasingly setting trends and capturing hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia casual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA post shared by SPLENGO FASHION (@splengofashion)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZendaya and Tom Holland proved they could make even the simplest outfits iconic during a laid-back outing in Calabasas, California. Both rocked white tank tops on this warm-weather date, each adding their own twist to the staple. Tom\u2019s style was effortless and classic: a simple white tank paired with dark brown joggers and white sneakers, bringing a cool athletic vibe that showcased his minimalist aesthetic\u200b. He kept accessories to a minimum, opting only for a casual gold chain that complemented Zendaya\u2019s chic look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZendaya, however, took the white tank into It girl territory. She layered her cropped tank under an oversized lime-green jacket, channeling a \u201990s-inspired silhouette that added bold colour and structure. Paired with high-waisted black shorts and Maison Margiela\u2019s edgy Tabi flats, she elevated the look from basic to fashion-forward. Her accessories \u2014 a sleek black tote and a slicked-back bun \u2014 perfectly captured her signature mix of relaxed and runway-ready style\u200b. As they strolled through town with Zendaya\u2019s mom, both Tom and Zendaya's outfits embodied essence of couple fashion: effortlessly coordinated but true to each person\u2019s unique vibe. Whether in high-fashion looks or low-key staples, they continue to be fashion's recent favourites with their trend-setting, yet relatable style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spider-Man: No Way Home Los Angeles premiere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZendaya and Tom at the Spider-Man: No Way Home premier. (Image: Amy Sussman\/Getty Images)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Spider-Man: No Way Home Los Angeles premiere, Zendaya truly understood the assignment, bringing a look that was both glamorous and on-brand. She wore a custom Valentino spiderweb gown was dripping in theatricality, blending her high-fashion taste with a cheeky nod to her character, MJ. The gown\u2019s nude base created the perfect canvas for the black, glittering spiderweb motifs that snaked across the fabric, giving her a webbed, slightly dangerous allure. With a plunging neckline, sky-high slit, and daring open back, this was Zendaya at her most captivating \u2014 giving fans both the sophistication of haute couture and the suspense of a Marvel premiere look\u200b.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut she didn\u2019t stop there. Zendaya leaned fully into the superhero theme with a lacy black domino mask, turning her into a high-fashion vigilante. Her box braids added a sleek, fierce edge, while sky-high Louboutins kept the look towering and elegant. Minimal Bvlgari jewellery allowed the intricate gown to take center stage, adding just the right touch of sparkle. Meanwhile, Tom was the picture of classic style in a Prada chocolate-brown suit. In a true power couple move, Holland skipped the flashy details, instead going for a refined, sleek look that allowed Zendaya to shine. His classic style provided the perfect balance to Zendaya\u2019s drama, creating a look that felt like the ultimate team-up\u200b.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Spider-Man photocall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt their London photocall, Zendaya served character dressing done right. (Image: David M. Benett\/Getty Images)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZendaya didn\u2019t let the fashion momentum slow down. At a London Spider-Man photocall, she went full Brit-cool in a stormy grey Alexander McQueen blazer dress, dusted with silver spiderweb embroidery. This look was both edgy and elevated, perfectly capturing the dark, moody aesthetic of a superhero universe. The structured blazer gave her a commanding silhouette, while thigh-high black boots added just the right amount of glitz and glamour. By channelling a punk-inspired British edge, Zendaya effortlessly transitioned from red carpet glam to streetwear chic, proving her versatility and style savvy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom, meanwhile, leaned into his heritage with a classic leather jacket. Paired with understated boots and a crisp white shirt, he kept things polished and quintessentially British, matching Zendaya\u2019s vibe without competing. Together, they looked like characters from a James Bond-meets-comic-book crossover, striking the ideal balance between high fashion and character-driven style\u200b.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUncharted in New York\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA post shared by Just Jared (@justjared)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Uncharted screening in New York, Zendaya and Tom Holland served a masterclass in effortlessly cool couple style. Zendaya channelled a casual-chic, \u201cborrowed-from-the-boys\u201d look, wearing an oversized shirt that she styled as a mini dress, cinched at the waist to bring structure to the relaxed silhouette. The shirt\u2019s elongated cuffs and boxy shape added a hint of edginess, while sheer black tights and classic Louboutin pumps kept it elevated. Her beauty choices \u2014 a subtle smoky eye and voluminous blowout \u2014 softened the look, balancing casual and sophisticated like only Zendaya can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom complemented her perfectly, opting for a sleek grey suit paired with a black turtleneck \u2014 subtle, sharp, and timeless. His look was understated but intentional, letting Zendaya\u2019s bold style take centre stage while adding to their undeniable synergy as a couple. Together, they're an unmatched example of high-fashion sensibility meets effortless confidence. Together, they've shown that their couple style isn\u2019t just about coordinated outfits; it's about harmonising a unique aesthetic that still feels in tune with one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpringtime pastels in Boston\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA post shared by Time International (@time.international)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis casual, yet chic look saw the couple in complementing pastels during a springtime outing in Boston. Zendaya went for a mossy green cable-knit sweater paired with tailored trousers and white Nike sneakers, while Tom chose a lavender T-shirt, styled with tailored pants and matching chunky sneakers. Their pastel outfits brought a fresh, breezy vibe to spring, showing how effortlessly they coordinate even in the simplest of settings\u200b.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance at the Romeo and Juliet Show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Just Jared Jr. (@justjaredjr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Tom Holland\u2019s Romeo and Juliet performance, Zendaya went full Shakespearean, supporting her real-life Romeo in a breathtaking Vivienne Westwood ensemble.

And then came Rafael Nadal, a force so unstoppable on the court he practically redefined what it meant to \u201cdress for the game.\u201d Not just any player, Nadal was the gladiator with the heart of a champion and the wardrobe of a renegade. From the early days of sleeveless shirts and pirate pants, his outfits made statements louder than his thunderous forehands. Rafael Nadal's best on-court outfits haven\u2019t just pushed the envelope; they\u2019ve rewritten the rulebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to athletes with a signature style, the 38-year-old is in a league of his own. With his recent retirement, we're not just looking back at his legendary career and 22 Grand Slam titles; we're reminiscing about his style that transformed the look of the sport itself. Known for his powerful forehand and unbreakable willpower, Nadal didn\u2019t just break records on the clay courts of the French Open (Roland-Garros) \u2014 he shattered traditional tennis dress codes. With each outfit, he embodied a different version of himself: the fearless newcomer, the unbeatable clay king, the tenacious champion, and finally, the sports icon bowing out with dignity and style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis fashion was more than just apparel; it was a form of self-expression, a part of his identity, and, yes, a marketing sensation. As a youth favourite, Nadal's daring sleeveless shirts, pirate pants, and bold colour choices sent a clear message: he wasn\u2019t here to play by anyone\u2019s rules but his own. Rafael Nadal's best on-court outfits weren\u2019t just memorable \u2014 they were revolutionary. They spoke to young fans, encouraged individuality, and proved that a traditional sport like tennis could carry a touch of rebellious spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether he was smashing his opponents in the vibrant greens and purples of his Nike kits or making a statement in the all-black gear of a US Open night session, Rafael Nadal's best on-court outfits have left an indelible impact on tennis history and fans worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRafael Nadal\u2019s legacy on and off the court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[embed]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qu-ABwRlKc0[\/embed]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom his entrance onto the ATP scene, Rafael Nadal didn\u2019t just play the game \u2014 he changed the entire style of it. His impact began with his now-famous 2005 debut at Roland-Garros, where he donned a green sleeveless top and white pirate pants, an unconventional look that signalled a fresh, defiant presence in a sport steeped in traditional dress codes. This bold choice was more than a personal style statement; it was a cultural shift that caught the attention of a global audience and set a new tone for what tennis fashion could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditionally, tennis attire for men was conservative and polished, with muted colours and strict lines. Nadal turned this on its head, embracing vibrant colours, sleeveless tops, and capri-style pants, which became synonymous with his brand. Nike, recognising his unique energy, crafted exclusive designs for him that consistently made waves both on and off the court. As he racked up Grand Slam titles, Nadal\u2019s outfits \u2014 from bright reds and greens to all-black night-session kits \u2014 became cultural moments in their own right, embodying the passion and power that defined his playing style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis visual branding extended Nadal\u2019s influence beyond just a series of winning outfits; it solidified him as a generational icon, especially among younger fans who appreciated his fresh approach to sportswear. His ability to blend strength with self-expression set him apart from other players, and his \u201cRafa\u201d look became instantly recognisable worldwide. These designs not only boosted Nike\u2019s sales but also created a tennis culture that welcomed flair and individuality, inspiring fans and players alike to see style as an extension of their performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009 Nadal surprised fans by ditching the sleeveless shirts for a cleaner silhouette on his way to victory at the 2009 Australian Open. (Image credit: Getty Images)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the years passed, Nadal\u2019s wardrobe evolved with his career. In 2009, he transitioned from sleeveless tops to classic short-sleeved polos, signalling a shift to a more mature style while still maintaining his unique edge. This evolution wasn\u2019t just a nod to the natural progression of his career but reflected his adaptability and depth as an athlete. And with each new phase, Nike ensured that Rafael Nadal's best on-court outfits continued to capture his spirit, from the rebellious pirate pants to the sleek and powerful all-black kits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNadal\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t just about titles and records; it\u2019s about a style revolution that challenged norms and celebrated individuality. His iconic looks inspired new generations to bring personality to the sport, showing that tennis fashion could be bold, innovative, and a little rebellious. In redefining the sport\u2019s aesthetics, Nadal proved that on-court fashion isn\u2019t just about following tradition; it\u2019s about creating a legacy that resonates as strongly as the game itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRafael Nadal's best on-court outfits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Wearing a sleeveless green top with white capri pants, plus a headband that added a gladiator touch, he was impossible to ignore. The look wasn\u2019t just fresh \u2014 it was a statement that the game\u2019s style norms were shifting. Nadal\u2019s powerful, relentless play style matched the fierce outfit, making his four-set win over Mariano Puerta feel like the arrival of a new king of clay. Nike\u2019s sleeveless tops quickly sold out, and Rafa\u2019s headbands became must-haves for fans who wanted to capture a bit of that \u201cwarrior on clay\u201d energy. This was no typical Grand Slam debut; it was the start of a whole new look in tennis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

That year, he rocked a blue sleeveless top with black pirate pants, paired with his trademark headband \u2014 a look that had become synonymous with his unstoppable clay-court play. His intensity in the final against Federer was echoed by the fierce blue-and-black combo, a perfect match to his game style. Rafa\u2019s fans went all in, with Nike\u2019s sleeveless shirts and black shorts flying off the shelves as young players adopted his style. This match marked not just another win for Nadal but a solidification of his \u201cKing of clay\u201d persona. This was the year Rafa\u2019s style really took hold, blending fashion with maximum power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

That year, his look was bolder than ever: a neon green sleeveless top paired with white-brown capri pants. The colour screamed confidence, an exact match to Nadal\u2019s fearless play style. His outfit lit up the clay, and his intensity was on full display. At the finals, he met Federer, with whom his rivalry had become legendary, and beat him with an almost surreal 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 score.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFans went wild over the bright green top, and Nike quickly capitalised on its popularity, producing more neon gear that quickly sold out. The outfit became iconic, a look as dominant and memorable as his performance. Young players took to the courts in sleeveless neon green tops, channelling that unstoppable Nadal spirit. The 2008 Roland-Garros look is still remembered as one of Rafael Nadal\u2019s best on-court outfits, combining bold colour palettes with a flawless performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

His sleeveless red top and matching shorts made this look one of the most memorable outfits of his career, showing that he was representing Spain with everything he had. The headband and wristbands, always on brand, rounded out the look that would lead to a gold medal. Fans went wild for this patriotic theme, and Nike launched a collection celebrating national pride. This wasn\u2019t just an outfit; it was a celebration of his roots and a message of loyalty and dedication to his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Wimbledon, 2008\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[embed]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U5Af1jGgYqA[\/embed]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2008 Wimbledon final between Nadal and Federer is considered one of the greatest tennis matches in history, and Rafa\u2019s sleeveless white look became iconic. Wimbledon\u2019s strict dress code requires all-white attire, but Nadal brought his own edge to the traditional look with a sleeveless top and tailored white shorts. His classic headband and wristbands completed the look, a nod to his signature style. He wore Nike Air Max Breathe Cage shoes, designed to give him extra support and stability on the grass, crucial for his long rallies against Federer in the final. In an epic five-set showdown lasting nearly five hours, Nadal defeated the Swiss player in a match that captivated fans worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment he lifted the trophy, soaked in rain and triumph, his sleeveless white outfit took on a new life, symbolising a modern champion with a fearless approach to the sport. Nike quickly capitalised on the sleeveless white tops, which flew off shelves as fans embraced his twist on tradition. This look blended the classic elegance of Wimbledon with Rafa\u2019s warrior spirit, marking a pivotal moment in his career and in tennis fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.

This shoe also displayed his \u201cRaging Bull\u201d logo, adding a personal touch to his dark, formidable look. The sleek, head-to-toe black with neon pink accents became a visual symbol of Nadal\u2019s intensity, especially under the New York night lights. With his biceps out, headband tight, and black wristbands, he looked like a force of nature on the court, a look fans found both powerful and intimidating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the final, he faced Novak Djokovic, winning in four sets to complete his career Grand Slam. Fans and media were captivated by the dark look, and Nike\u2019s \u201cRafa black\u201d kits became an immediate hit, with fans clamouring to adopt his night-session aesthetic. This kit didn\u2019t just mark his first US Open win \u2014 it symbolised a new kind of tennis fashion that blended sleek style with pure grit. Nadal\u2019s all-black look became a trend for night matches, showing that tennis attire could have the same power as any competitive performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.

(Image: Getty Images)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNadal kept it classic at the 2012 French Open (Roland-Garros) with a red top and white shorts, creating a sharp, clean look that radiated power. His victory over Djokovic in the final to claim his seventh French Open title in this kit made the outfit even more memorable. Fans embraced the red-and-white colour scheme, and Nike\u2019s collection reflected the classic vibe with a Rafa twist. The kit was both traditional and fierce, showing that Rafa could dominate in style while staying true to the clay-court tradition he\u2019d made his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Roland-Garros, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the 2013 French Open, Rafa went with a patriotic twist \u2014 a red, white, and blue ensemble that honoured both his Spanish roots and his connection with Roland-Garros. The kit was vibrant, and his win over David Ferrer in straight sets added to its impact. Fans loved the unique colour-blocking and it quickly became one of Rafael Nadal's best on-court outfits. This look wasn\u2019t just about winning; it was a tribute to Rafa\u2019s ties to the clay in France, a nod to the country that had become the site of his greatest victories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.

This outfit was more than just fashion \u2014 it was a tribute to his unmatched dominance on clay. In the final, he crushed Stan Wawrinka in straight sets, making the kit instantly legendary. The bold blue colour and fluorescent accents matched his confidence, showing he was as much a champion as he was a style icon. Nike launched a commemorative \u201cD\u00e9cima\u201d line to celebrate the occasion, and it became a massive hit, quickly selling out as fans rushed to celebrate the milestone. The 2017 Roland-Garros kit is a symbol of Nadal\u2019s lasting legacy, a look that\u2019s remembered as a perfect blend of celebration and dominance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.

(Image: Roland-Garros)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNadal\u2019s 2018 French Open look was as simple as it was powerful: an all-cerulean blue kit from headband to shoes. This monochrome look was clean, strong, and highlighted his connection to the Roland-Garros clay. Facing Dominic Thiem in the final, Rafa powered through in straight sets to claim his 11th title, making this kit a fan favourite. Nike\u2019s all-blue collection quickly sold out as fans embraced the monochromatic head-to-toe look. It was a bold move to go all in on one colour, but Nadal\u2019s confidence made it work. This outfit became iconic for its minimalist style, reflecting his comfort and power on the clay while keeping his look fresh and modern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.

His sleeveless kit was both nostalgic and fresh, paired with the NikeCourt Zoom Cage 3, his go-to shoes for hard courts. The sleeveless top was reminiscent of his early days, with the black-and-purple tones adding a new edge. Fans were thrilled to see the sleeveless look return, and the black-and-purple combo felt both nostalgic and modern. Nadal\u2019s five-set battle with Daniil Medvedev in the final cemented the outfit\u2019s place in history, marking one of the most intense matches of his career. This outfit wasn\u2019t just a style choice; it was a poignant reminder of Nadal\u2019s evolution, his roots, and his continued strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.

This wasn\u2019t just an outfit \u2014 it was the look that saw him make history, achieving his record-breaking 21st Grand Slam title. His five-set comeback against Daniil Medvedev, which saw him overcome a two-set deficit, was one of his career\u2019s greatest feats, and this kit became iconic. Nike fans couldn\u2019t get enough of the purple and teal, and the outfit quickly sold out as a collectible piece for those wanting to commemorate Rafa\u2019s milestone. This kit reflects Rafa\u2019s enduring spirit, his fighting style, and his role as a true champion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Main and Featured Image: Roland Garros and Clive Mason\/Getty Images)\r\nThis story first appeared here.\r\n\r\n "},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Valentino to Herm\u00e8s: A look inside BTS Suga\u2019s luxury bag collection","position":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/style\/fashion\/most-expensive-bags-of-bts-suga-min-yoongi\/","description":"\r\nMin Yoongi, aka Suga of BTS, is one of the fastest and most accomplished rappers in the K-pop scene.

Even though he is not in the best of form lately, the Spaniard attracts a majority of the limelight in every tournament he participates in. He\u2019s known for donning the best timepieces as well. So, take a look at the watch collection of Rafael Nadal.\r\n\r\nWith such widespread popularity comes an incredible fortune. As is expected, Rafael Nadal\u00a0ranks among the richest tennis players in the world.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report by\u00a0Celebrity Net Worth, Nadal enjoys a net worth of USD 220 million as of 2024. This means that he has the luxury to afford all the riches money can buy. Among many of his expensive assets, the Spanish player's penchant for watches is quite famous.\r\n\r\nNadal made headlines for his appearance at the French Open 2024, and boy, do those headlines cover a wide spectrum. On the more sombre side, he made news for crashing out of the French Open 2024 in the first round in straight sets, a truly shocking feat given that he has won the coveted title a record 14 times.\r\n\r\nHowever, horologists and watch aficionados were more interested in the news the Spaniard made by wearing an exciting new Richard Mille timepiece on the court. For context, Richard Mille recently launched a special 'Rafael Nadal' edition of its iconic RM 27-05 Flying Tourbillion.\r\n\r\nNadal's partnership with Richard Mille is well-known. As a matter of fact, the watchmaker approached the Spaniard for the first time in 2008 with the proposal of crafting a custom-made watch that could withstand the grind of a tennis match. While it took some time to get Nadal on the same page, in 2010 the launch of the signature RM 027 marked the dawn of a new era.\r\n\r\nOnce an occasional watch-wearer and not a big fan of the idea of wrist candies, today, the tennis legend boasts of an enviable collection, including quite a few Richard Mille timepieces. So, join us as we delve deep into the watch collection of Rafael Nadal and find out more about his Richard Mille timepieces, including their prices.\r\nA look at the best timepieces in Rafael Nadal's collection of watches\r\nRichard Mille RM 27-04\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280873\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 2.15 million (HKD 16.7 million)\r\n\r\nLet us kick-start the watch collection of Rafael Nadal with the Richard Mille RM 27-04. This timepiece was introduced by the Swiss watchmaker to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its partnership with the Spaniard.\r\n\r\nThe watch comes with a TitaCarb case, which is a high-performance polyamide with 38.5 per cent carbon fiber. This material makes the timepiece shock-resistant yet light on the wrist (weighing only 30 grams). It is fitted with a rubber strap.\r\n\r\nThe dial of the watch sports a mesh of metal strings which is reminiscent of the strings on a tennis racquet. These strings are more than just a design element though as they help hold the manual winding tourbillion RM 27-04 movement in place. The mechanical movement can provide up to 38 hours of power reserve with each of its winding.\r\n\r\nA unique watch, the RM 27-04 is a limited edition model of which Richard Mille has made only 50 pieces. This is also the most expensive timepiece in the expansive watch collection of Rafael Nadal.\r\nRichard Mille RM 27-01\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280875\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 1.75 million (HKD 13.6 million)\r\n\r\nAfter the success of the RM 027 in 2010, Richard Mille decided to revisit its signature Rafael Nadal watch in 2013. This time, the aim was to make a watch so light that the wearer wouldn't feel its weight on their wrist. The idea gave birth to the RM 27-01.\r\n\r\nAt just 18.83 grams, the RM 27-01 broke the record for being the lightest watch in history! Its weight is inclusive of its rubber strap (which, by the way, is the heaviest part of the model). This watch is powered by the manual winding tourbillion RM 27-01. The base plate of the mechanical movement is attached to the watch's case by four braided steel cables.\r\n\r\nIn terms of durability, the timepiece's case is crafted out of NTPT carbon, a material that is shock-resistant and can endure extreme conditions.\r\nRichard Mille RM 27-03\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280877\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 1.68 million (HKD 13 million)\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Richard Mille introduced the world to its RM 27-03, the fourth generation of its iconic RM 027 watch. This time (pun not intended), the watchmaker decided to make use of quartz for the watch's case and body instead of carbon and titanium.\r\n\r\nThe red-and-yellow TPT Quartz case is a tribute to Nadal's Spanish heritage. However, many in the horology fraternity interpret it as an embodiment of Nadal's fiery, aggressive persona on the tennis court. Besides the design aesthetics, the quartz case is also durable to the core with high shock resistance.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, the timepiece is powered by Richard Mille's in-house manual winding RM 27-03 tourbillion. This is a rare watch in Rafael Nadal's collection, with the brand only making 50 pieces.\r\nRichard Mille RM 027\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280879\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 1.6 million (HKD 12.4 million)\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Richard Mille made a memorable appearance on the tennis court with the RM 027 adorning Rafael Nadal's wrist.\r\n\r\nThis particular timepiece was a product of immense hard work and rigorous testing. In fact, to withstand the rigours of professional tennis, the watchmaker fitted the timepiece with a case made of a unique composite shock-resistant material \u2014 Carbon NTPT.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its release, the RM 027, with its rubber strap, was the lightest watch in the world (weighing 20 grams). The record has since been broken by the RM 27-01. This watch is powered by the manual winding RM 027 tourbillion, a lightweight mechanical movement made of titanium and a LITAL alloy (high in lithium).\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nadal enjoyed great success wearing this watch as he won the French Open, Wimbledon Open and the US Open, and also finished as the runner-up of the season-ending ATP Tour Finals.\r\nRichard Mille RM 27-02\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280881\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 1.3 million (HKD 10.1 million)\r\n\r\nThe third generation of Rafael Nadal's signature watch, the Richard Mille RM 27-02 was introduced in 2016. This model also stays true to the ethos of RM 027 in terms of its durability with a TPT Quartz case. In fact, it was the first time that the RM lineup made use of quartz as the case material.\r\n\r\nRichard Mille made use of Carbon TPT to create the brand's first-ever 'unibody' skeletonised baseplate. For context, the 'unibody' concept fuses the movement, baseplate and case back together.\r\n\r\nEven though this is an innovative watch, Nadal did not enjoy much success wearing it on the court as in 2016, he did not win a single Grand Slam tournament. Quite an unfortunate blot on the RM 27-02's reputation.\r\nRichard Mille RM 35-03 White\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280883\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 1 million (HKD 7.7 million)\r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the iconic RM 027 watch and its successors, Richard Mille crafted the RM 35 lineup and named it the 'Baby Nadal' collection. But what makes it different from the signature series?\r\n\r\nUnlike the RM 27 lineup, the RM 35 series lacks a tourbillion and is marketed by the watchmaker as a 'time-only' watch. The RM 35-03, however, retains most of the design elements of the RM 027, including a skeletonised dial, a lightweight durable case and great shock resistance.\r\n\r\nIn the RM 35-03, Richard Mille introduced its patented butterfly rotor in the automatic movement. The timepiece also boasts a sports mode and a function selector.\r\n\r\nThe RM 35-03, in its white carbon case, is the perfect match for the elegance and suave of the Spaniard. This is also the only timepiece in Rafael Nadal's watch collection outside the RM 027 lineup that has a price tag of USD 1 million and above.\r\nRichard Mille RM 35-03 Blue\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280885\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 850,000 (HKD 6.6 million)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the white Richard Mille RM 35-03, Rafael Nadal also owns a blue variant of the same watch as part of his collection. Besides the change in colour of the TPT Quartz case from white to blue, the rest of the watch is identical to the one discussed above.\r\n\r\nHowever, the greater demand for the white variant did result in a higher price tag. As such, this blue iteration costs around USD 150,000 less.\r\nRichard Mille RM 35-02\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280887\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 420,000 (HKD 3.2 million)\r\n\r\nThe RM 35 series gained massive popularity among luxury watch aficionados. However, many of them were unhappy about the absence of a self-winding mechanical movement in the 'Baby Nadal' lineup. This, in turn, prompted Richard Mille to make significant changes in the RM 35-02.\r\n\r\nA product of months of hard work, the RMAL1 calibre in RM 35-02 is a skeletonised self-winding automatic movement with hours, minutes and seconds functions. In addition, the movement also sports a variable-geometry rotor.\r\n\r\nThe Carbon TPT case of the watch ensures that it is shock-resistant to the core. To further cement its durability, Richard Mille crafted the baseplate and bridges of the RMAL1 calibre in wet-sandblasted grade 5 titanium.\r\nRichard Mille RM 11-03\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280889\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 400,000 (HKD 3.1 million)\r\n\r\nIn contrast to all the other timepieces in Rafael Nadal's watch collection mentioned on this list, the Richard Mille RM 11-03 was not tailor-made for the tennis star. This is because he never wore it on the tennis court. Basically, he did not need the lightweight casing material and the tourbillion.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the rose-gold RM 11-03 is slightly on the heavier side. Besides the absence of a carbon or quartz case, the chronograph also contributes greatly to the weight of the watch. For context, the watch is powered by a flyback chronograph automatic skeletonised movement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the timepiece comes with a 60-minute countdown timer situated at nine o'clock, a 12-hour totaliser, an oversized date display and a month indicator.\r\nRichard Mille RM 35-01\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280891\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Picture Credits: Richard Mille[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPrice:\u00a0USD 312,440 (HKD 2.4 million)\r\n\r\nLast but not least in Rafael Nadal's watch collection is the Richard Mille RM 35-01. This watch, which was released in 2014, is known for its powerful movement that offers high-impact resistance.\r\n\r\nThe RMUL3 calibre, a skeletonised manual winding movement, is made of grade 5 titanium (which explains its durability). Comprising 24 jewels, the mechanical movement offers a power reserve of up to 55 hours with each of its winding. The entire movement weighs a mere four grams.\r\n\r\nThis powerful mechanical movement is encased by a Carbon TPT body which is shock-resistant, offering Nadal the flexibility to play in his signature aggressive style without worrying about the timepiece.\r\n\r\n(Main and Featured Images Credits: Richard Mille)\r\n\r\nThis story first appeared here."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Human Made Hong Kong opens in Repulse Bay Village","position":11,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/style\/fashion\/human-made-repulse-bay-village-hong-kong-opening-october-2024-info\/","description":"Human Made has officially opened its latest flagship store in Repulse Bay Village, Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupying the corner of an old colonial building along a popular beachside resort area, Human Made Repulse Bay arrives just a month after the opening of dining experience Curry Up a few stores down.

From a sports commodity to a cultural touch point, the transition of sneakers into the cool quotient is driven by several causes, with basketball and the NBA at the forefront.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5279993\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Jordan 1 Retro High OG - Ivano-Frankivsk\/ Shutterstock[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe 1980\u2019s was when the shoe transitioned from just a means of sport, to a cultural phenom for the first time - courtesy of Nike\u2019s Air Jordans and the NBA superstar Micheal Jordan. Cut to a decade later and sneakers have become thoroughfare where everybody wants to cop the new cool sneaker and add it to their collection. From originals to retail, signature shoes of basketball stars to designer collaborations like Virgil Abloh\u2019s redesigned Air Jordan 1, The Off-White \u00d7 Air Jordan 1 High OG \u201cChicago\u201d- basketball sneakers are everywhere. From the high fashion runaways to homegrown sneaker retailers like Superkicks and CrepDog crew, the craze around these cultural objects has ballooned massively. \u00a0In the previous year alone, it estimated that sneakers generate more than $75 billion in sales worldwide in 2023. In a time plagued by \u2018sneakerheads\u2019 and sneaker collectors, we may as well be in a renaissance of sneakers and sneaker culture.\r\n\r\nWith Team USA\u2019s new dream team led by Lebron James clinching gold at the Paris Olympics 2024, there\u2019s no better time to visit the everlasting relationship between basketball and sneakers then now.\r\nThe origin of the sneaker \r\nIn the 18th century, shoes with a new rubber sole came into focus, used in various sports like tennis and running. They were soon termed Sneakers, after the rubber soles that allowed them to \u201csneak up\u201d on others. The first Basketball sneaker of significance came into being in the 1900\u2019s, namely the Converse All Stars. The non-skid shoes catered to the sport of basketball became the company\u2019s spearhead, a statement sport centric piece. They were also called Chuck Taylor\u2019s All-Stars after the basketball player, even now fondly remembered as the Chucks. While the shoe garnered significant attention, dominating the markets as the first original basketball sneaker- it was a different pair that raised sneakers to the status of a culture symbol.\r\nThe rise of the sneaker\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5279995\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Michael Jordan takes flight in the Air Jordan XI Black\/Dark Concord-White via Nike[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the 1970\u2019s, sneakers started to become associated with black culture and hip hop in the underground circuits, another significant influence in the shoes journey. However, it was in 1984 when the movement truly found footing with the launch of the Air Jordan Ones, spiraling sneakers to cultural stardom. The rest of the 80\u2019s saw a significant shift in the perception of the shoes with basketball\u2019s golden child Micheal Jordan as its global ambassador. Sneakers became the new cool, a symbol of status and what you wear to \u201cBe like Mike.\u201d Jordans went on to become the most popular basketball sneakers of the 80s and arguably of all time, much like its namesake. Today the legacy heavy sneaker comes in 23 different models and is still the most sought-after basketball shoe. However, in the years since the Jordans first burst onto the sneaker market; the industry has evolved in more ways than one. Today we stand at the junction of a new generation of basketball sneakers.\r\nA new generation of sneakers\r\nEverybody loves a good pair of sneakers. From celebrities on their casual outings to fashionistas pairing them with suits, sneakers are a staple in new age fashion for everyone, everywhere. And if you\u2019re not wearing sneakers by now, you\u2019re most likely living under a rock. The 2010\u2019s saw a significant rise in sneaker culture \u2013 initially as a symbol of luxury or status. Eccentric sneaker collabs with celebrities, musicians and designers have become collectibles for todays generation of \u2018sneaker heads\u2019 with wardrobes dedicated to display their prized shoes. Sounds funny right? But basketball sneakers have long elevated from just sports essentials to high fashion designer wear. Take for example Raf Simons x Adidas Ozweego Bunny \u2018Core White\u2019 that launched in 2017 or Pharrell Williams x Adidas NMD Hu \u2018Yellow\u2019 in 2016, designer sneakers have become sought after necessities.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C5_EmdjL-uV\/?hl=en\r\n\r\nNow sneakers have also become readily available on a global scale, with local resellers like Superkicks and CrepDog Crew bridging the gap. Different iterations and collectible designs are now just a click away. Despite the hyper commercialization of basketball sneakers, the heart of the shoes hasn\u2019t been lost. Signature shoes of stars continue to be prized as were the original Jordans. From Luka Doncic\u2019s Jordan Luka 2 with the Jordan DNA to the hottest basketball sneakers of the season, the Adidas AE 1\u00a0that has single handedly revitalised younger and newer signature shoes. Following the terrific year of Anthony Edwards who is undoubtedly the face of the new generation NBA, his signature sneakers have been catching all the right attention. Only recently, after Minnesota Timberwolves win in the playoffs, I spotted the sneakers on Superkick\u2019s website, an unsaid example of the persisting relevance of basketball with sneakers. After all while elevated to the style symbol, at its crux the sneakers are an aid to the game of basketball, and the primary addition to a player\u2019s arsenal of commodities.\r\n\r\nHero image: Courtesy Adidas\/ Anthony Edwards (Ig).\u00a0"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Supreme online shop expands to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Singapore","position":17,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/style\/fashion\/supreme-online-shop-hong-kong-macau-taiwan-singapore-asia-expansion-info-2\/","description":"After opening locations in Seoul in 2023 and Shanghai earlier in March, Supreme is gearing up to open up online stores across previously untouched regions in Asia including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, and Singapore beginning October 26, 10AM local time.\r\n\r\nThe move comes just three months after eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica acquired Supreme from VF Corporation for US$1.5 billion (approximately HK$11.7 billion).

If true, this would be that a new square case design is on the way in both a time-only and a version with a big date combined with a moon phase, day, and small seconds sandwiched at the bottom of the dial.\r\n\r\nThe watch appears to be a more angular take on the Nautilus with familiar design cues like horizontal striping and \"ears\" at the sides of the case. While it has not officially been confirmed, sources indicate that this watch will be unveiled in Munich on Thursday, October 17. This watch does align with Patek Philippe CEO, Thierry Stern's vision of reaching a new generation of Patek heirloom holders with a watch priced around the $35,000 range.\r\n\r\nSo far, the only full look at the watch shows the Cubitus paired with a tonal fabric strap with contrast stitching with a centre-link fixture reminiscent of the 5980 and 5726.

Yee is credited for establishing the brand's timeless legacy in performance eyewear with more than 110 patented designs including the Oakley Eye Jacket, Zero, and OVERTHETOP sunglasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Lifestyle Asia Hong Kong (@lifestyleasiahk)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving brought a suitcase of carefully labeled archive pieces for his debut solo exhibition, we asked Yee to pick designs instrumental to the Oakley story. For our conversation, Yee chose the Time Bomb II, Eye Jacket, and the X-Metal Romeo which will be the focus of this editorial.\r\n\r\nThe X-Metal Romeo was the world's first-ever 3-D sculpted, hypoallergenic, all-metal frame and at the time, the strongest sunglasses ever made by a long shot. Built to withstand the weight of a car, the Oakley team reportedly drove over one with a tank to test its durability.\r\n\r\nAs the legend goes, it took 27 different machines, 425,000 watts of electricity at 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit, and 75 pairs of hands to manufacture the X-Metal Romeo. The individually-numbered frames marked a breakthrough in structural physics, built using top-secret metallurgical processes involving an undisclosed bunker in Nevada.\r\n\r\nCementing its place in history, the USD$250 sunglasses (now nowhere to be found for under 5x its original price) were promoted by a roster of sports celebrities including Olympic medalists, NBA players, MLB players, and champions from extreme sports such as surfing and snowboarding. In film, they have also been popularised in blockbusters such as Mission Impossible II. In an age where fashion styles come and go like the wind, the Oakley silhouettes have stood the test of time, admired by the masses and adored by a growing cult of enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nBelow, we dive into how the frames were conceived from the perspective of the designer and learn more about where Yee is headed following his departure from Oakley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease tell us about the X-Metal Romeo.\r\n\r\nThis is the first design of the X-metal collection. This project was happening in the back room behind closed doors over the years. The concept was from the founder. He wanted to create something that had never been done before. There were many of us designers working on it. I was fortunate enough to be the one to define the final design of the collection and figure out the language and how this works.\r\n\r\nIt's cast titanium and there are all these segmented pieces with connections so that things would flex as they could and should with compliant flex couplers. This thing is so stout. This will outlast all of us. When we are all passed away and our bones turn to dust, this thing will still exist.\r\n\r\nIt's a testament to Oakley's commitment at that time to design and create something truly special that didn't exist before. If we look back in 20\/20 hindsight at how the X-metal collection has been revered, collected, and coveted, I think it did what it was intended to do.\r\n\r\nIt became the flagship of the brand. It represented Oakley's differentiated thinking and approach to creating things. I'm really proud that I got to work on this with amazing people and an amazing team.\r\n\r\nOakley's always been a standout brand, but it seems like there is now a new generation that has embraced it for the nostalgia that they might not have been part of. There's a new wave of people hunting for the stuff you created. How does that make you feel?\r\n\r\nI don't know that I could be any more proud. I feel so honored that people appreciate the work I did such a long time ago, as well as maybe my current work. As we know, fashion in general is very cyclical. Things that happened before come back, but I don't think that everything is cyclical. I think what happens is the designs that were crafted well in its time, those do come back. If we use that definition, it may mean that the things I've designed were designed and crafted well.\r\n\r\nIf I did my job correctly and used the correct fundamentals of design, then the attraction to it should still hold firm. However, it ebbs and flows too. Self-servingly, I believe that it is the good designs that come back and are in favor. If in our fashion culture today, people are regaining or finding these designs that I've done, it's extremely flattering and maybe it's tied to my design approach.\r\n\r\nIt's like if you had somebody like a singer or an artist and they have this amazing hit, but it's a one-hit wonder, that's it. But if I look at the designs I've worked on that are considered iconic or in favor or sought after, there's way more than a handful. So it more likely has to speak to the approach to design and sensitivity that I use.\r\n\r\nHaving invested so much in Oakley over 25 years, what made you want to move on?\r\n\r\nI joined Oakley in January 1993 and left the beginning of 2018. So January 2018 was two anniversaries. I turned 50 and I hit my 25th year with the brand. So being Asian and liking numbers, half of your life working for the brand seems like a pretty good point in time to maybe move on. \r\n\r\nI still see people [from Oakley] from time to time. I have dear friends who work there doing phenomenal work but things evolve. I want to continue to evolve myself as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat led you to want to create your own brand?\r\n\r\nThere's a quote I saw that goes \"success is your responsibility.\" That hit me because I know how to do a lot of stuff at a very high level and it made me realise that I've been coasting. It made me realise that I'm still at the age where I've got a lot of energy and I have the intellect and creativity to do it. If I were to die today, it would be all the cool Oakley stuff but what if I don't die today, and when I die later, the Oakley stuff is just the first half of the book? How interesting could the second half be?\r\n\r\nI owe it to my family and fans to do more stuff. Wouldn't it be great to create a brand that they'd want to work at one day? Maybe I could create a brand that could leave a legacy even when I'm gone \u2014 that fulfills people's needs in some way and that isn't copies of something else. That would be cool to leave that legacy. To build a brand on my beliefs.\r\n\r\nHistorically all the designs I've done that are popular have been copied so likely there won't be anything to show until I'm ready to show. I like to do hard things. Everything that I do won't be easy so when it's not easy it's hard to tell how long that will take.\r\n\r\nWhat is your approach with your creative agency PYD Inc.?\r\n\r\nI don't take all the clients that come to me because I have to like them. It's important to work with people I like to work with because when I'm working on your project, I'm not working for a client, I'm working for my friend and I want to make the best things for my friends and there's nothing I won't do for my friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Lifestyle Asia Hong Kong (@lifestyleasiahk)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did the brand name \"XYE\" (pronounced ex-yee) come about?\r\n\r\nBack in the day, I played a good amount of video games on the Xbox and then later on Xbox 360. My gamertag was X-Toy from a sports car in NSX. So that's my regular life. In my professional life, a lot of my designs use adjectives with the letter \"X\" in them as my designs are pretty extreme. I believe in design excellence. Excitement. A myriad of words that represent it [X]. Romeo is the first design of the X-Metal collection. So in my mind, X represents kind of the crossroad between art, science, function, creativity, and the laws of physics.\r\n\r\nTo this day, I get texts from my friends. There is a \"Hey, Peter, it's X.\" So X is my nickname and I call them in return by their gamertag. Hey, Notorious. Hey, Deluxe, etc. That's just how we roll. So that's what it stands for. It's literally my nickname and my last name. \"YEE\" when I first wrote it, had the long vowel sound symbol, the line. That's the phonetic spelling of my last name but I just took the line off. So \"XYE\" is my name in code because the idea is that the brand is me. It's what I believe in terms of design and what I want to bring to the world.\r\n\r\nHow would you describe your design language and are there any peers or contemporaries that you take inspiration from?\r\n\r\nThat's a great question. I think one of my superpowers in terms of how I design is my ignorance. I say that because I approach things with my ignorance, I don't know what's possible but that also means I don't know what's impossible. I'll try things and my ignorance also extends to what other people are doing.\r\n\r\nI don't know what other people are doing. It has nothing to do with me and what I'm doing. That's not to say there aren't great examples of artists and designers that do good work. That's not the case. It's just that \u2014 let's say in this case when I approach eyewear, the last thing I'm looking at for inspiration or ideas is other eyewear.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean I'm ignorant of what exists, but when I look at other things, I use them more as examples of what not to do because if it's already done, I don't need to do it. I'm not a copy machine. When I'm designing, my approach is to bring something unique and beautiful to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStay tuned for two more episodes in which Peter Yee speaks about the Time Bomb II and Eye Jacket.\r\n\r\nInterviewer\/Producer: Ambrose Leung\r\nVideo: Ryan Putranto\r\nEditor: Aaron Chow"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Demna renews contract with Balenciaga","position":23,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/style\/demna-set-to-stay-with-balenciaga\/","description":"Demna is sticking with Balenciaga!\r\n\r\nAccording to\u00a0WWD,\u00a0the Georgian fashion designer and Vetements co-founder has renewed his contract as Balenciaga's creative director for an unspecified term.\r\n\r\nNow in his 9th year with Balenciaga, Demna took the reigns of the fashion house's creative director back in 2015 where Alexander Wang previously held the title.

What started as a simple headphone brand back in 2006 quickly morphed into a cultural symbol for the music and tech worlds. Dre leveraged his expertise in the music industry to create headphones that weren\u2019t just functional but also incredibly stylish. That move paid off \u2014 Beats by Dre now pulls in USD 1.5 billion annually.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Apple acquired Beats for a whopping USD 3 billion, marking one of the biggest celebrity business deals in history. Dre\u2019s brand continues to thrive under Apple\u2019s ownership, with its sleek design and high-quality sound attracting a massive audience. Whether you\u2019re a casual listener or a hardcore audiophile, Beats has become a go-to product, especially with a search popularity of 3.7 million annually. The brand also taps into pop culture, regularly featuring in music videos and athletic meets, solidifying its global appeal among all audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Kim K didn\u2019t just create a shapewear brand; she redefined shapewear. Skims is all about inclusivity \u2014 serving up body-positive solutions that actually make you feel good. No more suffocating shapewear that leaves you feeling like you need to exhale for the rest of your life. Skims? It\u2019s comfy, stylish, and practical. Whether you're lounging in their buttery-soft loungewear or rocking one of their iconic bodysuits, you\u2019re always looking snatched and feeling yourself.\n\n\n\nWith an annual revenue of USD 750 million and 4.2 million searches, Skims is blowing up. One of the reasons it\u2019s so successful? Kim\u2019s unmatched social media game. She brings Skims directly to her 360 million Instagram followers, showing off real bodies (like her sisters and celebrity friends) in her campaigns, proving it\u2019s not just about looking good \u2014 it\u2019s also about embracing your shape.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Skims\u2019 collabs with everyone from high-fashion brands to Team USA during the Olympics have helped catapult it from shapewear company to fashion empire. Add to that some major celeb endorsements (like Charlie XCX, Nicola Coughlan and more), and it\u2019s clear that Skims is here to stay.\n\n\n\n3. Selena Gomez \u2013 Rare Beauty\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nA post shared by Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez (@rarebeauty)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRare Beauty by Selena Gomez is doing more than selling makeup \u2014 it\u2019s spreading a message. Launched in 2020, Rare Beauty champions self-acceptance and inclusivity, which is totally in line with Gomez\u2019s personal advocacy for mental health. Rare isn\u2019t about covering up your flaws; it\u2019s about celebrating what makes you, well, YOU.\n\n\n\nWith USD 600 million in revenue and 3.3 million searches annually, Rare Beauty is a movement. Selena\u2019s vulnerability about her own struggles with mental health resonates with all audiences. Since its launch, Rare Beauty has been a hit, with products like the Soft Pinch Liquid Blush and Liquid Touch Foundation flying off the shelves. The best part? The brand has made inclusivity its priority, offering a 48-shade foundation range right out of the gate and setting the standard for other beauty brands.\n\n\n\nRare Beauty\u2019s social campaigns? Pure fire. The brand leans heavily into TikTok, with influencers and everyday users showing how they use the products in authentic, easy-to-digest ways. Gomez herself often posts makeup tutorials that feel like you're watching your best friend get ready in her bedroom. It\u2019s this kind of relatability that\u2019s driving Rare\u2019s ongoing success.\n\n\n\n4. Rihanna \u2013 Fenty Beauty\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nA post shared by FENTY BEAUTY BY RIHANNA (@fentybeauty)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Fenty Beauty launched in 2017, it broke the internet. Rihanna wasn\u2019t playing around \u2014 she changed the beauty game forever by launching with 40 shades of foundation (which later expanded to 50), setting a new standard for inclusivity in the beauty world. No more guessing your shade or mixing foundations \u2014 Fenty made sure that everyone could find their match.\n\n\n\nFenty Beauty\u2019s annual revenue sits at USD 582 million with a staggering 4.9 million searches, making it the most-searched, and one of the most successful celebrity-owned businesses. The numbers don\u2019t lie: people are obsessed with RiRi\u2019s brainchild. Its success is largely due to Rihanna's unapologetic approach to beauty and branding. It\u2019s for the people who\u2019ve been left out of beauty conversations for way too long.\n\n\n\nRihanna\u2019s marketing? On point. From the iconic Fenty Beauty Body Lava campaigns to the \u201cBeauty for All\u201d tagline, Fenty\u2019s advertising is as fierce as its creator. Let\u2019s not forget the influencer partnerships, where everyone from top-tier makeup artists to micro-influencers are hyping up the products on social media. Plus, Fenty Beauty\u2019s digital-first strategy with Sephora, YouTube tutorials, and real user-generated content makes the brand feel incredibly approachable.\n\n\n\n5.

Johansson\u2019s focus on clean, sustainable beauty is well-timed, as consumers are increasingly demanding transparency in their skincare. With a few hero products like the Firming Vegan Collagen Serum, The Outset is poised to grow in the skincare market.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

Dwayne Johnson \u2013 Teremana Tequila\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nA post shared by Teremana Tequila (@teremana)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s switch gears (literally) to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who went from wrestling legend to Hollywood superstar. And now? He\u2019s a tequila kingpin. Launched in 2020, Teremana Tequila is already pulling in USD 83.3 million annually. But here\u2019s the thing: Teremana isn\u2019t just another celeb-backed booze brand. It\u2019s personal. The name \u201cTeremana\u201d comes from the words \u201cTerre,\u201d meaning earth, and \u201cMana,\u201d meaning spirit, representing Johnson\u2019s connection to the land and his Polynesian heritage. It\u2019s got heart \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s made it resonate with consumers.\n\n\n\nSo why is it gaining such momentum? Well, first off, Johnson is involved in every aspect of the brand. We\u2019re talking Instagram videos where he\u2019s behind the bar mixing margaritas and giving actual recommendations. Teremana\u2019s vibe is all about being premium, but approachable. You don\u2019t need to be a tequila snob to enjoy it \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes it a hit with younger consumers who are looking for authenticity.\n\n\n\nIts sustainability efforts also give it a major edge \u2014 Teremana\u2019s tequila is made using traditional methods with a focus on eco-friendly production. The Rock\u2019s fans love that he\u2019s putting his personal stamp on something that\u2019s high-quality but doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Throw in some epic \u201cTera Tuesday\u201d campaigns on social media, where Johnson shows off how to enjoy the perfect Teremana cocktail, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for success.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.

Considering the appeal of luxury timepieces and their fashion quotient, several K-pop stars are known to be avid watch collectors. On many occasions, Thai rapper and GOT7 member BamBam has displayed his fondness for timepieces by flaunting some of the most exquisite watches. From Richard Mille to Patek Philippe and Jacob & Co., let us look at the luxury watch collection of BamBam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamBam (a.k.a. Kunpimook Bhuwakul), who recently appeared as a celebrity host on Super Rich in Korea could very well be one of the contestants given the luxury assets he owns. He was named Louis Vuitton's house ambassador this year and joins fellow GOT7 member Jackson Wang and J-Hope from BTS who have also earned the same honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his upcoming Bamesis tour with stops in Hong Kong and Canada, we bet BamBam has no trouble keeping track of multiple timezones with his beautiful timepieces. Let's have a look at some of the most extravagant timepieces in the watch collection of BamBam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInside the exquisite watch collection of BamBam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob & Co. Casino Tourbillon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamBam's love for blingy and unique watches is reflected in this casino model from Jacob & Co. (Image: BamBam\/Instagram; Jacob & Co.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapper's love for all things bold and beautiful can be seen in his choice of watches, and a favourite from his collection is the Casino Tourbillon model from Jacob & Co. BamBam has drawn attention to his wrist by sporting this spectacular watch on several occasions and it has also been featured in some of his Instagram posts. An instant eye-catcher, the Casino Tourbillon is a celebration of the casino vibe that is synonymous with Las Vegas and Macau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highlight of this timepiece is its onyx dial which impressively features a fully functional game of roulette. Its masterful engineering allows the timepiece to function as a portable game with a wheel head that spins fast along, with the white ball bouncing across the dial. In an unboxing video of this stunning watch, BamBam admitted it felt like he was in Vegas as he tried his luck at the game of chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Mille RM52 -01 Skull Tourbillon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamBam also owns a limited edition Richard Mille watch. (Image: BamBam\/Facebook; Richard Mille)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most exclusive watches in BamBam's collection is the limited edition Richard Mille RM52 -01 Skull Tourbillon piece. This model aptly combines mechanical mastery and elaborate design in true haute horology fashion. Multiple elements in this watch make it a special timepiece, including how it uses the skull design with a skeletonised baseplate and how the upper and lower jaws hold the ruby encrusted on the tourbillon cage. What's also amazing is that this limited edition piece is a celebrity favourite. Apart from BamBam, it has also been spotted on the wrists of other famous personalities including Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan and Brazilian footballer Neymar Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob & Co Astronomia Solar Zodiac\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most stunning watches in BamBam's collection is this Jacob & Co. timepiece which features an exquisite rendering of our solar system. (Image: BamBam\/Instagram; Jacob & Co.\/Facebook)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidently a favourite timepiece from BamBam's collection, the Jacob & Co Astronomia Solar Zodiac model has been seen on the Thai star's wrist on several special occasions including during an appearance at an NBA game. The eye-catching design of this watch is a sight to behold, making it a particularly fascinating vision for astronomy fans. Bringing the solar system right to your hand, the design of this timepiece proffers a view straight out of an observatory. The highlight of this watch is its magical blend of constant motion and precision, replicating the nature of the celestial bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an unobstructed 360-degree view of the intricate movement, the rotating platform displays exquisite constellations plucked from the sky. Additionally, a double-axis flying tourbillon and gemstone planets with four rotating satellites operate on the calibre JCAM19, enhancing its movement. With only 101 pieces available worldwide, the limited edition piece is a coveted accessory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAudemars Piguet Royal Oak Fully Iced Out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamBam's watch collection is full of bling-covered timepieces. (Image: BamBam\/Facebook; Audemars Piguet)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamBam doesn't like to part ways with his luxury watches \u2014 not even when he is on adventurous variety shows. The K-pop idol was once spotted proudly flaunting his Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Fully Iced Out watch while filming the variety show City Fishermen (also known as The Fishermen And The City). The bedazzled watch has also made an appearance in one of his Vogue interviews, where he revealed that he had gifted it to himself upon completing his first ever world tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Oak model is an incredible display of bling, considering it is entirely encrusted in diamonds with very little metal on display. A symbol of luxury and opulence, this timepiece is among the most extravagant watches in BamBam's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatek Philippe Nautilus Ref. 5719\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamBam also owns the luxurious Patek Philippe Nautilus 5719 model. (Image: BamBam\/Instagram; Patek Philippe)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet another glittering timepiece in BamBam's watch collection is the Patek Philippe Nautilus Ref. 5719 piece that truly epitomises affluence in every way. The watch is fully set with over 1,300 diamonds, which cover the dial as well as much of the bracelet. With its octagonal-shaped bezel and white gold case, the watch impresses with its splendid design, which belongs to the renowned Patek Philippe Nautilus collection. This flawless watch makes for a great accompaniment to lift up even the most demure looks. BamBam has been spotted sporting this dazzling watch at press interactions as well as for photoshoots. Considering the craftsmanship and accuracy offered by Patek Philippe, it is evident why an avid watch collector like BamBam would choose to own this piece of luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFranck Muller V45 Vanguard Classical Rose Gold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamBam's watch collection consists of diverse brands. (Image: BamBam\/Facebook; Franck Muller)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing we can deduce from BamBam's taste in watches, it's that he enjoys bling on his wrist. This proposition holds true when we consider this Franck Muller V45 Vanguard piece from his collection. This spectacular watch is instantly noticeable thanks to the array of diamonds that dazzle on its bezel along with its dial, which features bold numerals. Additionally, the captivating shape of the timepiece also provides a sporty yet luxurious aesthetic. Given its unique look and features, it is a coveted piece that is priced at approximately USD 55,558 (approx HKD 431,408)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it for the watch collection of BamBam.

The label defined that era of fashion with bold logos, playful products, and heavy referencing. This was also at a time when streetwear's attention to detail was heading into luxury fashion territory with price points following suit. Catapulting Off-White's popularity was the highly sought-after collaboration with Nike.\r\n\r\nVirgil solidified his status as a key designer when, in 2018, he took up the role of Artistic Director at Louis Vuitton. Sadly, in 2021, Abloh died at the age of 41 due to complications with cardiac angiosarcoma.\r\n\r\nJoey Gabbay, CEO of Bluestar Alliance, commented, \"Virgil was a creative pioneer who had a profound impact on the global fashion industry and creative community. Acquiring Off-White represents a unique opportunity for Bluestar Alliance to honor and build upon the enduring legacy of Virgil Abloh.

Her looks are like visual poems with hidden meanings and easter eggs diligently monitored and decoded by Swifties. Whether we take into account the edgy, gothic-inspired aesthetic of the Reputation era or the flamboyant, pastel-hued silhouettes of the Lover era, Swift's outfits have as much of a story to tell as her lyrics. While she is known to wear many designers, the era-defining artist tends to gravitate towards some more than others. Today, we hone in on the 11 luxury fashion brands Taylor Swift wears the most!\n\n\n\nBefore we begin, let's take a look at the impact the 34-year-old pop culture royal has had on decades-old fashion brands.\n\n\n\nThe impact of Taylor Swift on luxury fashion brands\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/rfvyB4XH8nQ?si=bKYCXkbA2ZwSWZIU\n\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s colossal influence extends far beyond local economies to pervade the ever-evolving realm of global pop culture. A prime example: her dazzling Eras tour fashion looks that have inadvertently piqued the interest of consumers in the brands she's worn on stage. A study from Launchmetrics has revealed that Swift\u2019s crystal Versace bodysuits generated USD 6.3 million for the Italian luxury brand.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, the labels she favours for red carpets also benefit from this 'Taylor Swift effect'. According to the Red Carpet Power Rankings, Taylor's red carpet looks created the greatest Media Impact Value (MIV) when compared to her Hollywood counterparts. The singer's 2024 Grammy Awards Schiaparelli gown, for instance, generated USD 6.8 million for the brand.\n\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that just this past week, Swift sported a range of iconic Gucci items. She began by accessorising her US Open courtside Reformation dress with a glossy Gucci Jackie Notte handbag, before stepping out in a head-to-toe Gucci look that cost upwards of USD 8,800. Considering her impact on fashion, it won't be long before the benefits of 'Swiftonomics' trickle down to fuel sales for the Italian luxury fashion house.\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/usopen\/status\/1832840988592615525\n\n\n\n\nIf we take account of the influence she has had on national economies, the 'Swift Quake' caused by the Eras tour in Seattle, and her famed entry into the billionaire club, Taylor Swift's impact on luxury fashion brands may be just another feather in her cap. However, for the fashion industry, Swift's patronage has made revolutionary waves.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the American pop rock phenomenon wields immense fashion influence partly because she does not associate herself with any single label. This creates an indelible impression among consumers that Swift wears certain brands because of the quality and trust they hold, and not because she gets paid for it.\n\n\n\nThat being said, here are 11 luxury fashion brands that Miss Americana drifts back to time and time again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe luxury fashion brands most frequently worn by Taylor Swift\n\n\n\nOscar De La Renta\n\n\n\nTaylor in a satin Oscar De La Renta gown at the world premier of Cats. (Image: Kevin Mazur\/ Getty Images)\n\n\n\nOscar De La Renta outfits probably occupy as much space in Swift's house as her 100+ strong guitar collection. The Hollywood-loved designer synonymous with folkloric silhouettes has played a key role in styling Swift for her most coveted events. Of course, glam-inducing floriated dresses are what the designer does best, so if you spot Swift in an ethereal creation like the one pictured above, know it is Oscar De La Renta she has to thank for it.\n\n\n\nVersace\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C_lVAHsNCmK\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\n\n\nYou could count the sequins on the silver Versace blazer that Swift wears while performing \"The Man\" during the Eras tour, and it would still be less than the number of times she has worn the brand. The luxury fashion label has a slew of high-octane celebrities within its trust circle and the songstress is one of them. Swift has notably worn Versace at the 2016 Grammy Awards and has also incorporated the brand's designs in her 2024 Eras tour outfits. Now, she's bringing the brand to the NFL. Swift is often seen attending Chiefs games in outfits by Atelier Versace, making up a great deal of her best fashion moments. Most recently on September 5, the singer was seen cheering on her boyfriend Travis Kelce in a Medusa top by Versace.\n\n\n\nRoberto Cavalli\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CwbH1FaphET\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian fashion house has been Taylor Swift's go-to choice for the entirety of the Eras tour, and for good reason. You can watch Swift go from dancing in her \"best dress fearless\" to calling out haters in \"look what you made me do,\" all in fanciful Roberto Cavalli numbers. Fun fact: the singer's Reputation-coded Roberto Cavalli black catsuit is the only on-stage outfit without an alternate option.\n\n\n\nChristian Louboutin\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift at the Eras Tour in custom bedecked Christian Louboutin. (Image: Christian Louboutin)\n\n\n\nConsidering that Swift has worn more than 250 pairs of custom Christian Louboutins at the Eras tour alone, it's not a reach to conclude that the luxury label is her most revered choice for footwear. In a conversation with Vogue, Christian Louboutin revealed that 60 of the 250 dazzling pairs were created specifically for the European leg of her larger-than-life tour. What's amazing is that every bejewelled pair matches perfectly with the rest of Taylor's on-stage outfits, making them look like a complete set. It's no wonder that the French label is one of Swift's favourite luxury fashion brands.\n\n\n\nElie Saab\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift in an Elie Saab teal ombre gown. (Image: Kevin Mazur\/WireImage)\n\n\n\nElie Saab has been Taylor Swift's red carpet staple for over a decade. The singer is often spotted in the designer's fascinating asymmetric dresses. The ombre blue and teal number pictured above deserves a spotlight of its own, what with the exquisite shoulder cutouts and a silhouette that perfectly emulates both a mini dress and a gown.\n\n\n\n\n\nZuhair Murad\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CqN1OrlNXn_\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\n\n\nIf we were lucky enough to be at Taylor Swift's sold-out tour (which we were not), we'd be making as much noise for this crystal-embellished blue bodysuit as we would for the singer's \"cat eye sharp enough to kill a man.\" The singer has donned various iterations of the Zuhair Murad couture bodysuit, all of which feature sparkling beaded fabric in shades of midnight blue, perfectly keeping in line with the Midnight era of her three-hour set. Swift has also graced many a red carpet in sultry Zuhair Murad numbers.\n\n\n\nStella McCartney\n\n\n\nSwift in a Stella McCartney rugby shirt that she wore as a mini dress. (Image: Raymond Hall\/GC Images)\n\n\n\nIt's rare enough that one can claim to be Taylor Swift's favourite luxury fashion brand, but Stella McCartney has taken it one step further. The designer, who received a shoutout from the Grammy winner in her mega-hit song \"London Boy\" is one of Swift's close friends and favourite designers. From sneakers and dresses to coats and mini skirts, Swift's street-style wardrobe is peppered with the designer's most coveted items. Swift has even gone so far as to collaborate with McCartney on her Lover-inspired clothing collection.\n\n\n\nVivienne Westwood\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C6zCtbvyVBv\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\n\n\nIt would be almost blasphemous to talk about luxury fashion brands most worn by Taylor Swift without the mention of Vivienne Westwood. The designer excels in the case of on-stage glamour, as is evident from the \"Fortnight\"-inspired white corseted gown that sent the internet into overdrive after the singer debuted it for the first time in Milan. Most recently, Swift wore a casual but elegant pale blue Vivienne Westwood dress while out and about with Travis Kelce and friends.\n\n\n\nAla\u00efa\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C2d7c83LErm\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\n\n\nIf you ever spot Swift in a little black dress, chances are that the wardrobe essential is from one of her favourite brands, Ala\u00efa. Whether the star is hitting the clubs with her besties or on a Lake Como getaway with boyfriend Travis Kelce, this is the brand Taylor reaches for when she's dressing off-duty!\n\n\n\nLouis Vuitton\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C_qZXqwvKZw\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n\n\n\nLouis Vuitton has made a handful of appearances during Swift's public engagements \u2014 from roadside jaunts to red carpet revelries. A classic piece she straps on time and time again is the brand's Camera Box Bag that marries\u00a0tradition with a contemporary twist. Any LV item is ideal for adding a 'new money' touch to her otherwise quiet luxury-dominated wardrobe. This includes the Louis Vuitton Coussin Bag that Swift recently sported on September 6 2024, while she was out on a date night with beau Travis Kelce. She also opted to complete her all-black look with the brand's quilted Donna High Boot.\n\n\n\nRalph Lauren\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Cy4o56mOk0Z\/?igsh=bnZsY250eTV1OGUz\n\n\n\n\nRalph Lauren features heavily in Taylor Swift's sartorial wardrobe choices. Not only does the singer own the label's classic cable-knit sweater in six different colours, she was also spotted wearing their corduroy jacket while posing for photos for her TIME Person of the Year feature. Taylor was later seen wearing the same jacket while out in NYC, sparking speculations that she took the item home after the photoshoot.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Main and featured image: Christian Louboutin.com)\n\n\n\nThis story first appeared here.\n"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"CHANEL Cruise 2024\/25 runway show to be held at the Hong Kong Design Institute","position":34,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/style\/chanel-cruise-2024-25-hong-kong-runway-show\/","description":"CHANEL's Cruise 2024\/25 runway show in Hong Kong has a location.\r\n\r\nSet for November 5, the Cruise collection was first unveiled in May in Marseille, France and it is coming to Hong Kong S.A.R for its Asia showing.\r\n\r\nThe location has also been revealed where it will be taking place at the Hong Kong Design Institute.

Roquemaurel explained that in the 17th century, a Murano glassmaker accidentally dropped some metal shavings into his glass that was cooling off. This mixture gave the glass a multicoloured sparkling appearance when it crystallised where he called it all\u2019avventura, Italian for \"by chance.\" The dial beautifully captures the spirit of adventure that the watch brand represents, and even the watch model itself, as \"Antarctica is the best place to see the stars,\" exclaimed Roquemaurel.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the diamond versions special is that an entirely new cut was created by GT Cadrans just for the invisible-set indexes. While a standard baguette cut stone has a minimum of 14 facets, the Czapek Flying Diamond version has 24 facets with 14 on the pavilion and 10 on the table for maximum light reflection.\r\n\r\nThis limited edition Czapek & Cie. Antarctique is composed of four references: Antarctique Polar Sky 40.5mm without diamonds (99 pieces), 38.5mm without diamonds (77 pieces), Antarctique Flying Diamonds 40.5mm with diamond indexes and optional diamond-set case and bracelet (8 pieces), and a 38.5mm version (18 pieces)."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Carnival's new ASICS GT-2160 are in full bloom","position":39,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/style\/carnival-asics-concrete-bloom-gt-2160\/","description":"CARNIVAL and Asics are back again for a new collaboration -- this time in the form of the \"Concrete Bloom\" GT-2160.\r\n\r\nThis pair tells the story of how even through the toughest conditions, weeds and plants can grow through the cracks of city streets and burst through concrete in order to seek light.

Karina is the leader of the group with members Giselle, Winter, and Ningning. The group gained popularity since their debut thanks to their unique \"metaverse\" concept and hyperpop music.\r\n\r\nSince their debut, many of their singles have become viral hits. Their debut single, \"Black Mamba\" became one such hit, as well as other songs like \"Next Level\", \"Girls\", and \"Drama\". One of their latest singles, \"Supernova\", became aespa's first track to top the Circle Digital Chart and reach the Top Ten on Billboard's Global Excl. U.S. chart.\r\n\r\nThe latest Prada ambassador is no stranger to taking on such a role. In previous years, aespa has become the face of Givenchy, becoming the first K-pop artist to do so for the French fashion house. They have also endorsed Korean brand Clio, Mediheal, and French brand Eider.\r\n\r\n(Images: Prada)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Mina of TWICE is Boucheron's new brand ambassador","position":41,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/style\/twice-mina-boucheron-new-brand-ambassador-details-news-info\/","description":"Boucheron has just announced Japanese artist Mina, a member of the popular K-pop girl group TWICE, as its latest brand ambassador.\r\n\r\nTWICE's Mina is joining the French high jewellery brand as its next ambassador.
