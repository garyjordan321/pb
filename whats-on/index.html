FEST is taking over Hong Kong this December","position":3,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/whats-on\/panda-go-fest-hong-kong-december-allrightsreserved-details-info\/","description":"Who else is still inflicted with the panda craze? Get ready for the upcoming PANDA GO! FEST this December, which is set to be the largest panda exhibition in Hong Kong. 2,500 panda sculptures will take over the city every weekend in a different location. Keep reading below to find out where to catch the adorable pandas.\r\n\r\nIt's been a big year for the panda family in Hong Kong. In August, Ocean Park welcomed the birth of the panda twins, followed by the arrival of two giant pandas the following month. The PANDA GO! FEST celebrates all the new additions to the family with 2,500 sculptures featuring eight unique designs. Organised by AllRightsReserved (ARR), the same brand behind 100% DORAEMON & FRIENDS this summer, the event is going to be an adorable way to end the year with a bang.\r\nPANDA GO! FEST, the largest panda exhibition in Hong Kong\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years ago, ARR launched the 1600 PANDAS WORLD TOUR, featuring 1,600 panda sculptures. This number matched the giant panda population at the time. This time, PANDA GO! FEST will feature 2,500 panda sculptures, making it the largest panda exhibition in Hong Kong. It also matches the current giant panda population, which increased over the years thanks to global conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the sculptures are getting a fresh new look with eight new panda designs. These new designs are based on the characters of Panda Friends & Family Hong Kong (PFF HK), an exclusive Hong Kong IP created by ARR. The characters are based on the giant pandas residing in Hong Kong: Ying Ying, Le Le, Ke Ke, An An, and the twin pandas, Big Sister and Little Brother. The pandas' unique physical features and character traits are visible on each character.\r\n\r\nThe PANDA GO! FEST will kick off with an exclusive grand welcoming ceremony on December 2 at Hong Kong International Airport. Afterwards, the pandas will take over the city's iconic landmarks on weekends and during Christmas in December. The journey starts on December 7\u20138 when the pandas will visit the Avenue of Stars at Tsim Sha Tsui. The following week on December 15\u201316, they will head over to Ngong Ping 360. Then, visitors can find the sculptures at Ocean Park on December 21\u201322, visiting their real-life counterparts. Finally, the journey comes to a grand finale on December 25\u201326 at Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.\r\nPANDA GO! Specials featuring renowned artists to be auctioned\r\n\r\n\r\nOn top of the public event, there will also be an online auction of some special-edition panda designs. PANDA GO! FEST is inviting 11 renowned artists and figures to create one-of-a-kind panda sculptures. One such artist is Pharrell Williams, the popular musician and the current Men's creative director of Louis Vuitton. Kasing Lung, the artist behind the viral LABUBU dolls will also present his own panda sculpture. Other participating figures include the actor and director Huang Bo as well as supermodel and actress Du Juan.\r\n\r\nThe highest bidder can get their hands on the unique pandas by participating in an online auction. Proceeds from the auction will be donated in full to Ocean Park with no deductions. Royalties generated by PFF HK will be similarly donated. This money will go towards supporting the park's giant panda conservation efforts. Stay tuned for more details on the auction. Those interested can sign up online to be the first to hear any updates.\r\n\r\nDon't miss out on the PANDA GO! FEST to celebrate the adorable giant pandas while supporting conservation efforts.\r\n\r\n(Images: AllRightsReserved \/ Panda Friends & Family Hong Kong)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Guide to Clockenflap 2024 in Hong Kong: Getting there, schedule, tips, and more","position":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/whats-on\/events-whats-on\/clockenflap-2024-hong-kong-guide-transportation-accommodation-tips\/","description":"Clockenflap, Hong Kong\u2019s biggest outdoor music and arts Festival, is back this month.

You\u2019re welcome to move from one stage to another but if you\u2019re coming in later or in the middle of a set, you might not get the best view. Plan who to watch and where they\u2019ll be performing so that you can get a front-row view.\r\nWear comfortable and breathable clothing\r\nLook, you can come dressed to the nines. Luckily, the weather in Hong Kong is getting cooler so you don\u2019t have to worry about staying out under the scorching sun during Clockenflap 2024. That said, we\u2019re also keeping our fingers crossed that it doesn\u2019t rain. Given that there will be plenty of festival goers, it can still get quite warm and sweaty. So, we recommend dressing in breathable clothing to keep you comfortable while enjoying the performances.\r\nBring a portable charger\r\nChances are you\u2019d want to record your favourite artist or snap a photo with your friends, so make sure to keep your phone fully charged before heading off. If you\u2019re running low on battery, a portable charger always comes to the rescue. We recommend bringing two in just case!\r\nCome early\r\nEven if your favourite act isn\u2019t performing yet, do arrive early. Clockenflap doesn\u2019t just have music. There are also arts-related events, family-friendly activities, and plenty of food. Remember outside food is not allowed so give yourself time to eat because you need the energy to jump and vibe to the performances.

Here's your guide to exploring the unique wetland habitat.\r\nEverything to know about the Long Valley Nature Park in Hong Kong\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282304\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Image credit: LVNP website[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Long Valley Nature Park comprises three management zones \u2014 the Biodiversity Zone for core conservation, the Agriculture Zone for eco-friendly farming, and the Visitor Zone equipped with facilities for visitors and educational activities.\r\n\r\nEver since its conservation efforts in 2019, Long Valley Nature Park has achieved great results. Critically endangered Yellow-breasted Bunting, nests of Black-winged Stilt and endangered Black-faced spoonbill have all increased in numbers. The freshwater wetland in Long Valley provides a great habitat for amphibians, reptiles and water birds alike. Apart from better conserving the Long Valley, LVNP has also attained objectives of ecological conservation and agriculture.\r\n\r\nTo mark the opening, a two-day funfair was held at the venue. Featuring art crafting workshops, game booths, a farmers' market and live music performance \u2013 the launch happened with full pomp and fervour.\r\n\r\nHong Kong is home to over 25 national parks, the latest of which, Robin's Nest, opened earlier this year. The 530-hectare park at Sha Tau Kok features two scenic hiking trails, alongside species of high conservation value, such as\u00a0red azalea, incense tree, Chinese grassbird and Chinese pipistrelle. The city is also set to open its largest marine park, the North Lantau Marine Park, which will help protect Chinese White Dolphins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image credit: LVNP website)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"K-pop boy band AB6IX to hold a fan concert in Hong Kong this December","position":19,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/whats-on\/events-whats-on\/k-pop-boy-band-ab6ix-fan-concert-hong-kong-date-venue-ticket-details\/","description":"Hong Kong folks, kickstart your year-end festivities with a side of K-pop as AB6IX is holding a fan concert in the city this December.

Ocean Park hopes that the upcoming upgrade will enhance its appeal as an iconic leisure and entertainment destination in Hong Kong\u2019s southside.\r\nOcean Park in Hong Kong announces the opening of a new Adventure Zone\r\nThe Adventure Zone has three proposed areas, all thoughtfully designed to integrate seamlessly with the park\u2019s natural topography. Visitors can still get unparalleled mountain views and sea vistas. Furthermore, the park will approach the project by optimising land use to minimise environmental impact. So, instead, they will revitalise existing infrastructure and infuse it with new purposes such as the now-defunct Raging River and Mine Train.\r\n\r\nExpect thrilling attractions including an aerial experience at the former Boardwalk Cafe. It will feature two spine-tingling ziplines, one soaring above Water World Ocean Park and the other, weaving in and out of the green bushland.

This is the first time a dinosaur fossil has been ever found in the city, marking a historic discovery.\r\n\r\nThe fossil was unearthed at Port Island, located within the Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark. Experts have yet to identify the exact species and age of the fossil. However, based on a preliminary osteohistological analysis, it is likely a larger dinosaur from the Cretaceous period around 145 million to 66 million years ago. They speculate that the dinosaur was buried by sand and gravel after death, before getting washed to the surface due to a large flood and then re-buried at the discovery site.\r\n\r\n\"The discovery is of great significance and provides new evidence for research on palaeoecology in Hong Kong,\" says Bernadette Linn Hon-ho, Secretary for Development.\r\nA months-long process of research and collaboration\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280538\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1440\"] The dinosaur bone fossils discovered in Hong Kong (outlined in red).[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD) first notified the Antiquities and Monuments Office (AMO) of DEVB about the fossil in March. The AFCD suspected the sedimentary rock on Port Island would contain vertebrate fossils.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, experts from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted field investigations from June to August. This involved studying fossil specimens, formulating management strategies, and discussing future steps.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discovery of the dinosaur bone fossil, authorities have suspended public access to Port Island. This is to allow experts to conduct further research and excavations. Through this and preparing the fossils, the authorities hope to uncover the story of the dinosaurs in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it will also lead to more exciting discoveries.\r\nWhere to see the first dinosaur bone fossil discovered in Hong Kong\r\nFrom October 25 onwards, the public can view the dinosaur bone fossil at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. The AMO will also host talks at the centre to foster public interest in palaeontology. Experts from the IVPP will share their knowledge of dinosaurs and research with attendees during the talk.\r\n\r\n(Images: Antiquities and Monuments Office)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Green Day to bring their The Saviours Tour to Macau in 2025","position":41,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/whats-on\/events-whats-on\/green-day-macau-concert-2025-the-saviours-tour-details\/","description":"Whether you\u2019re a punk-rock fan or a millennial, it\u2019s time to rejoice for a night of spectacular performances.
