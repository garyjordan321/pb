revealed that it plans to open in Hong Kong and Taiwan this year. The move comes as part of its plan to expand its reach in the Asian market.\r\n\r\nThis September, Torikizoku opened its doors for the first time in Taipei. The opening was met with great excitement, to the point of overwhelming its registration system. Soon, the\u00a0izakaya chain will also make its debut in Hong Kong. The first location is set to open at Tuen Mun Town Plaza on December 16.\r\nTorikizoku to make Hong Kong debut\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the entrance of Torikizoku to the Hong Kong market, foodies in the city can enjoy an affordable option for\u00a0izakaya. Its first location at Tuen Mun Town Plaza is over 2,ooo square feet, seating nearly 100 guests. Whether customers are going solo, in pairs, or with a small group of friends, the restaurant is suitable for family gatherings and casual meet-ups.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the opening, the culinary team travelled to Japan to study the art of yakitori under seasoned chefs. Through careful control of the cooking temperature, the skewers retain its moisture. Additionally, the Hong Kong branch is importing specialised grilling equipment directly from Japan to equip its kitchen. This ensures the quality that customers get in Hong Kong is the same as Japan.\r\nSignature offerings\r\n\r\n\r\nAs one of the most affordable izakaya chains, Torikizoku has established itself as a mainstay in Japan's casual dining scene. Specialising in yakitori, the menu includes a diverse range of chicken skewers, with over twenty options available in Japan. Aside from the usual chicken meat skewers, customers can also indulge in the wings, liver, heart, gizzards, skin, gristle, and neck meat. Diners can choose between the signature secret sauce, salt, or spicy seasonings to coat their skewers. While the Hong Kong prices are currently unknown, all the skewers are available for \u00a5328 (approximately HK$17) in Japan.\r\n\r\nTorikizoku offers more than just yakitori. From appetizers, fried dishes, and snacks to rice, noodles, and desserts, there are plenty of choices for diners to choose from. Of course, just like any other\u00a0izakaya, the restaurant will also have an extensive selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to complement the food. By opening in the city, Torikizoku hopes to share Japan's izakaya culture and its communal essence with the people of Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nLocation: Shop 1108-1111, 1\/F, Tuen Mun Town Plaza Phase 1, 1 Tuen Shun Street, Tuen Mun\r\n\r\n(Images: Torikizoku Hong Kong)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"K11 Musea dining guide: The best restaurants to visit for your next meal","position":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/food\/k11-musea-restaurants-hong-kong-places-to-check-out\/","description":"K11 Musea is one of the most popular malls in Hong Kong.

For a behind-the-scenes look into how he develops new flavours, check out our interview with the chef.\r\n\r\nThe winter pop-up will also see the debut of the SNOWBALL Vanilla Tonka (HK$75). Inspired by the brand's signature product, these snowball cookies exude the sweet aroma of vanilla and tonka beans. Each cookie is crafted with roasted almond powder and flour, resulting in a light and crumbly texture. Finished with a coat of powdered sugar, these cookies look just like snowballs and will melt in your mouth too.\r\n\r\nAside from the new products, the Mr. CHEESECAKE pop-up will also sell the Mr. CHEESECAKE Classic (HK$349). Exclusive to Hong Kong, the classic flavour will come in a limited-edition festive packaging.

All it takes is counting calories and this breezy guide to drinks that are surprisingly guilt-free \u2014 coming in at under 150 calories per serving.\r\n\r\nIf the wild popularity of workout videos and healthy food products is anything to go by \u2014 fitness is in. And although alcohol is seen as an indulgence rather than a guilt-free investment \u2014 courtesy of sugar-laden cocktails and high-calorie beers and wines \u2014 there are plenty of ways to keep those abs while also letting your hair down at a bar. The key is to watch what you are drinking and counting calories \u2014 going for options that don\u2019t pack on the pounds and sticking to just a few of the same through the night. Here are a few that come in just under 150 calories while being delicious.\r\n\r\nPS: As a rule, skip the mixers or go for low-calorie, sugar-free versions of the same\r\nBest drinks to order at the bar if you\u2019re counting calories\r\nChampagne: 98 calories\r\nStarting out strong is a bubbly, elegant number that\u2019s at once fruity and creamy. A glass (120 ml) will set you back by about 98 calories approximately, according to a report by The Guardian \u2014 the brut or extra-brut variants, which translate to \u2018dry,\u2019 have lesser sugar in them and would hence have fewer calories. This is far more forgiving than other white wines as well as red wines. Calorie counts may vary by brand as well. For instance, a 750 ml bottle of Moet & Chandon Brut comes in at 622 calories, making each glass about 85-99 calories.\r\nVodka soda: 100 calories\r\nA classic if you\u2019re watching your calorie intake \u2014 this refreshing number features vodka and unflavoured club soda. Each glass comes in at about 100 calories. To add a touch of extra flavour you could request the bartender to garnish your drink with cucumber, mint, or a wedge of orange. A lemon spritz works just as well. Like with other drinks on this list, your choice of spirit can make all the difference. A 30 ml shot of Grey Goose, for instance, is just 66 calories as per the brand\u2019s official site. Meanwhile, soda doesn\u2019t add to this count at all.\r\nGin and Diet Tonic: 100 calories\r\nPerhaps one of the most popular bar orders \u2014 the classic G&T can pack quite the calories, courtesy of sugary tonic water. However, switch up the usual option with diet tonic water and you\u2019ve got yourself the perfect low-calorie sipper \u2014 about 100 calories per glass. Hendricks states that a measure of its gin is about 98 calories. Diet tonic, meanwhile, has no calories. Ice things up to really mellow out the sharpness of the alcohol. Garnish with fresh ingredients like cucumber and rosemary to amp up flavour.\r\nLight beer: 103\r\nRegular beer can pack on the pounds \u2014 hence the general fear of the \u2018beer belly\u2019 amongst malt enthusiasts. However, several brands have come up with low-ABV, lighter options that clock in just about 100 calories. In India, Bira91 has a \u2018Light\u2019 variant that comes in at about 80 calories approximately. Meanwhile, a pint of Carlsberg Lite will set you back by 102 calories. If that\u2019s not reason enough to grab a six-pack right away, we don\u2019t know what is.\r\nHard seltzer: 110 calories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Pursue Hard Seltzer (@pursuedrinks)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest described as a highball drink of sorts \u2014 carbonated water, alcohol, flavouring \u2014 hard seltzer is a go-to for many calorie-conscious drinkers. In India, a pint of Pursue comes in at 110 calories. Meanwhile, IST clocks in at about 99 calories. While these are delicious on their own, you can amp up the flavours by having yours served with a wedge of orange or some cucumber.\r\nRum and Diet Coke: 135 calories\r\nThere\u2019s no better way to hop on the diet soda bandwagon than to combine it with a delicious sugarcane number. Bacardi notes that a serving of its spiced rum clocks in about 90 calories, while Diet Coke has none.\r\nDry Martini: 150 Calories\r\nThis pop-culture go-to is quite forgiving in the calorie department, only setting one back by about 100 calories (120 ml), especially if you take into account Hendricks count of 98 calories per measure. This concoction also includes about 14 ml of vermouth, which comes in at about 50 calories. This is generally topped with olives or lemon wedges. Orange bitters also work wonders. You could ask the bartender to make yours dry, which involves more gin less vermouth and much fewer calories \u2014 ideal if you're counting and watching what you drink.\r\n\r\nAs always, drink responsibly!\r\n\r\nHero and feature images: Aram Dise\u00f1o\/Pexels"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Embark on a cheesy journey with the new Shake Shack Continental Cheese menu","position":11,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/shake-shack-continental-cheese-menu-tiramisu-shake-festive-offerings-details-info\/","description":"This holiday season, Shake Shack invites you on a culinary adventure with their new, limited-time Continental Cheese menu, an homage to the rich and diverse cheeses of Europe.

With that, we\u2019re launching a monthly edition of mixologist\u2019s recommendation where we ask them for their favourite places for a particular drink. For our inaugural edition, we\u2019re putting the spotlight on the classic martini. Federico Balzarini of the ARGO shares his recommendations on where to get the best martini in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nAh, the classic martini. It\u2019s a cocktail made with gin and vermouth often garnished with an olive or a lemon. It\u2019s one of the best-known alcoholic beverages. Its base spirit is simple. Over the years, however, different variations have popped up to tickle the fancy of many Hong Kong drinkers. So, if you\u2019re looking for the classic type or an elevated version, we've got you covered. We sought the help of Federico Balzarini, the beverage manager at ARGO for a list of top bars for martini in Hong Kong. Living by the motto, \u201cA great cocktail without a great experience is just a cocktail,\u201d Federico certainly has an impressive portfolio under his belt.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt 17 years old, he started working at a local bar in his hometown of Lake Garda in Northern Italy. It was where he found his calling and fell in love at first sight with cocktail making. He officially began his bartending career in another local cocktail bar and spent the next few years perfecting the basics of classic cocktails. Then, he moved to London to further his craft until he found his way to the American Bar at The Savoy. There, he worked with industry icons like Lorenzo Antinori, who\u2019ll pass him the baton at ARGO. Eventually, he arrived in Bangkok in 2021 to join Vesper before making his way to Hong Kong to lead ARGO. \r\n\r\nCheck out his top martini recommendations in Hong Kong, whether it\u2019s for happy hour or a relaxing evening.\r\nWhere to drink the best martini in Hong Kong, according to mixologist Federico Balzarini of Argo"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Arcane unveils three exclusive menus to celebrate 10th anniversary in November","position":18,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/arcane-10th-anniversary-november-tasting-menu-details-info\/","description":"This November marks a monumental milestone for Arcane.

Curry is an umbrella term for a dish made with a sauce seasoned with spices. It comes in many forms across countries from Japanese curry (usually eaten as \u201ckare raisu\u201d or curry rice) to Thai curry (called \u201ckaeng\u201d), or even a Filipino version in the form of \u201cginataang\u201d (cooked with coconut milk). But there\u2019s no denying that Indian curry is among the most popular. It\u2019s the dish that most are familiar with and love. It\u2019s impressive how many varieties there are, from rogan josh to the classic butter chicken. Nonetheless, there are plenty of places in Hong Kong where you can try authentic curry.\r\n\r\nSo, in our quest to find the top curry dishes in Hong Kong, we asked chef Manav Tuli, the chef-founder of Leela for his expertise. Chef Tuli boasts an incredible culinary background that spans almost two decades. He brings with him experience from esteemed kitchens across London, India, and now Hong Kong. Chef Tuli began his journey in Kerala before his talents landed him in Rajasthan. Then, he ventured beyond India to places like Mauritius before settling in London. He opened Tamarind, the first Indian restaurant in London to receive the coveted Michelin Star.\u00a0\r\n\r\nExpanding his horizons, chef Tuli set his sights on Hong Kong, helming Chaat from its opening until his departure in 2023. During his tenure, the restaurant earned its Michelin Star and many other awards. Chef Tuli\u2019s culinary prowess is currently on full display at Leela, a restaurant that showcases the regional cuisines of his country. So, here are his recommendations for the best curry in Hong Kong \u2014 tried and tested by an expert.\r\nWhere to find the best curry in Hong Kong, according to chef Manav Tuli of Leela"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"The best happy hour deals in Hong Kong right now!","position":20,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/drinks\/best-happy-hour-deals-in-hong-kong-2024\/","description":"Say goodbye to paying big bucks for just a tipple or two with Hong Kong\u2019s happy hour deals.

From casual street snacks to meticulously prepared cocktail creations, these are the best dishes and drinks to try in Hong Kong and abroad \u2014 the ones we\u2019d recommend you make a special trip for.\r\nThe\u00a0best dishes and drinks\u00a0we supped on and savoured this month:\r\nCornerstone\r\n\r\nThe dish: Chicken Parmigiana (HK$198)\r\n\r\nI have to admit, I'm not very familiar with Australian food as I've never been to Australia or eaten in much Australian restaurants in Hong Kong. Thankfully, Cornerstone, the contemporary bistro from The Arcane Collection, started introducing dishes that are inspired by chef Neal Ledesma's recent trip to Australia. So, I got to taste a little bit of the cuisine. The Aussie pub classic Chicken Parmigiana was an instant standout. Although it's been given a modern twist, I do love how filling it is. The chicken is super crunchy but not difficult to chew. The mortadella ham added some extra flavours and the indulgent mozzarella is also a nice complement to the crunchy texture. Some greens on the side act as a palate cleanser too. They're also very generous with the serving! \u2014 Jianne Soriano, Senior Digital Writer\r\n\r\nCornerstone, 49 Hollywood Road, Central, Hong Kong, +852 6809 9771\r\nCelestial Court Chinese Restaurant\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Sea Urchin and Chinese Cured Meat Clay Pot Rice (HK$888 for 6-course tasting menu)\r\n\r\nI recently had the privilege to be one of the first to try the latest menu from Marriott Bonvoy's \"Taste of Wonders\" campaign. This year, Marriott invited four top Chinese chefs from their properties including Chef Jacky from YUE, Chef Jayson from Man Ho (JW Marriott), Chef Jack from Celestial Court Chinese Restaurant, and Chef Leong from Man Ho (Skycity Marriott), to put together a Cantonese 6-course tasting menu set at an auspicious price of HK$888 per person and available until November 30. Each dish was a celebration of the delicacy, freshness, and warmth of Cantonese cuisine through the lens and mastery of the seasoned and innovative chefs.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day, Chef Jayson Tang's Double-Boiled Abalone Soup with Preserved Citrus and Jewel Orchids was comfort you could taste. Light and silky, the double-boiled soups extract nutrients from the ingredients for extra flavour and better absorption of the health benefits. The preserved citrus and jewel orchids soothe the throat while the dried conpoy and abalone nourish the liver. Another highlight was one of Chef Jack Chan's signature dishes at Celestial Court, the Braised Beef Rib and Sarcodon Aspratus Mushrooms with Five Spices Sauce which was perfectly cooked and seasoned.\r\n\r\nMy favourite dish of the night was Chef Leong's interpretation of a traditional Sai Kung dish. In the '60s sea urchins were not yet regarded as a premium ingredient. With Sai Kung brimming with urchins, fishermen often prepared the urchin\u2019s gonads (uni) by frying it with rice. As a street food enthusiast, Chef Leong chose to do a spin on clay pot rice. Raw rice is cooked to fluffy perfection with cured pork sausage and duck liver sausage. A truly massive fresh uni is added just before serving, sitting in the middle of the plate-like an egg on Japanese Omurice. A homemade sweet soy sauce is poured over top as a finishing touch. It was my first time having sea urchin in clay pot rice and am happy to report that it's a delicious match. \u2014 Aaron Chow, Editor\r\n\r\nCelestial Court Chinese Restaurant, 2\/F, Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel & Towers, 20 Nathan Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong\r\nSalisterra\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Spring Chicken (HK$288)\r\n\r\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good roast chicken? This dish really hits the spot when you\u2019re craving for some chicken. A whole chicken is marinated with yoghurt and spices and then served with a delicious red pepper sauce, making it perfect for sharing. The meat is perfectly tender, which makes it easy to eat with a knife and fork. The marinade creates a flavourful exterior while the sauce adds a little bit of heat to accompany each bite. While my entire meal at Salisterra was delicious, this dish was definitely the highlight for me. \u2014 Johanna Muliani, Editorial Assistant\r\n\r\n49\/F, The Upper House, Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, Admiralty, Hong Kong\r\nTequila on Davis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Nachos (Regular: HK$98, Large: HK$138)\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a classic dish at a Mexican restaurant, you can't go wrong with cheesy nachos.\r\nThe creamy flavor of the melted cheese, the refreshing flavor of the guacamole and sour cream, combined with the crunchy crispy corn chips offer a rich and satisfying flavor experience. I just can\u2019t stop!\r\nAnd of course, these cheesy nachos also pair perfectly with the fantastic cocktails often found at Mexican eateries. I really enjoyed the time spent with friends by the seaside of Kennedy Town. Believe me, nachos are the perfect snack to complement your evening. \u2013 Viola Zhang, Media Intern\r\n\r\nG\/F, 1 Davis Street, Kennedy Town, Western District\r\nOcean Empire Food Shop\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Century Egg Congee (HK$31)\r\n\r\nI was craving for something hot that will soothe my stomach and this was definitely it. Ocean Empire serves a plethora of congee with different variations that includes fish, pork as well as complimentary dishes like fried noodles and steamed rice rolls.\r\n\r\nI ordered the Century Egg Congee on it's own. There are also Chinese doughnuts, a bit of pork as well as green onions and nuts mixed together. It has a creamy and thick texture which I prefer in a congee. It also has a homey taste thanks to all the ingredients working in tandem with each other. If all old people food were more like this I would eat it more - maybe I'm just getting older. \u2013 Samson Jr C De Guzman, Assistant Multimedia Editor\r\n\r\nShop B, G\/F, Tung Fong Building, 151-155 Johnston Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong\r\nDa Vincenzo\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Cinghiale e Funghi (HK$178)\r\n\r\nI first came across this restaurant on profdrpizza\u2019s page, which rated Da Vincenzo as the best pizza in Kowloon. The place was surprisingly small, but it felt very homey. The menu was much bigger than I expected, with almost 20 pizza options on top of the appetisers and pasta. In the end, I went with the special menu, Cinghiale e Funghi pizza, to share with my boyfriend.\r\n\r\nThe pie featured mushrooms and wild boar salami, which piqued my interest. Each slice was perfectly balanced \u2014 the tangy tomato sauce countered the salty, gamey wild boar salami while the cheese and mushrooms were a nice touch for more texture and flavour. The crust had an impressive crunch without being too hard, which I really enjoyed. The soup and dessert weren\u2019t much to write about, but I will definitely be coming back for the pizza. Next time, I\u2019ll also be trying the pasta, which looked delicious. \u2014 Johanna Muliani, Editorial Assistant\r\n\r\nG\/F, 10 Pok Man Street, Tai Kok Tsui, Hong Kong\r\nCaprice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Daily Wild Caught Fish with Paimpol Bean Fricassee and Shellfish Emulsion (part of the Refined Power Lunch $1,288)\r\n\r\nFirst things first, Caprice's three Michelin star rating is definitely well-deserved. The service is fantastic, the ambience is amazing, and the food is of great quality and presentation. Among all that I had, my main dish the Daily Wild Caught Fish with Paimpol Bean Fricassee and Shellfish Emulsion was my favourite. That day, it was cod fish, which also turns out to be among my favourite. It was super soft and it created an instant \"melt in your mouth\" feeling. I don't think I've really gotten that much from fish. Despite its \"simple\"-looking sauce (complete with foam-y bits), it's actually quite flavourful. The bean and shellfish add more texture so they're best eaten with the fish. Delicate, soft, refreshing with every bite. \u2014 Jianne Soriano, Senior Digital Writer\r\n\r\nCaprice, Four Seasons Hong Kong, 6\/F, 8 Finance Street, Hong Kong, +852 3196 8882\r\nMott 32\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Hairy Crab Roe Claypot Rice (HK$1480 per person for Hairy Crab Menu)\r\n\r\nThe start of autumn also marks the start of Hairy Crab season! My first hairy crab meal this year at Mott 32 was a feast to remember. In the seasonal menu, Group Executive Chef Lee Man Sing showcases 10 innovative ways to enjoy hairy crabs imported from Yangcheng Lake in Suzhou.\r\n\r\nMy second best bite of this month also happened to be seafood-based claypot rice. For this dish, instead of having the rice on the bottom and the sauce and ingredients on top, the chef decided to serve the rice as a carefully toasted rice ball surrounded by a moat of Hairy Crab Roe. The best part of the claypot rice is usually the toasted ends closest to the pan. With the rice ball, the toasted texture was present throughout, which I thought was genius. Aside from the claypot dish, everything else on the menu was scrumptious and came together beautifully with the recommended wine pairings. The Hairy Crab Menu will be officially available at Mott 32 from November 1st to 15th a-la-carte style and via an exclusive set menu. \u2014 Aaron Chow, Editor\r\n\r\nStandard Chartered Bank Building, 4-4A Des Voeux Rd Central, Central, Hong Kong\r\nSushi Kumogaku\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Crab meat Tempura (HK$1,580 for Sunday special lunch with two-hour free-flow Dom P\u00e9rignon 2013 package for HKD 1,688 per person)\r\n\r\nWhat is the better way to spend your weekend than eating at one of the best omakase restaurants in town? Under the helm of Hong Kong\u2019s very own Chef Kin, Sushi Kumogaku now offers a special Sunday lunch experience. Priced at HK$1580 per person, the curated menu offers a selection of \u201ctsumami\u201d dishes that you can pair with from their extensive beverage menu. From five seasonal raw and cooked dishes to 10 nigiri pieces, depending on the freshest ingredients available from Japan on the day. The highlight of the dish comes down to the crab meat tempura (subject to availability); the tempura batter itself was crisp and light, covered with nori. Every bite bursts with succulent crab goodness\u2014it is the ultimate indulgence for crab lovers. \u2014 Janice Leung, Social Media Manager\r\n\r\n8\/F, Lower Block, H Code, 45 Pottinger St, Central, Hong Kong\r\nAmelia\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Prime Deluxe Unlimited Feast ($698 with +$328 option for Oyster, Lobster Tail, and Crab Legs)\r\n\r\nFree flow of Alaskan King Crab Legs, Maine Lobster Tails and Hokkaido Senposhi Fresh Oysters, need I say more?\r\n\r\nBy the beautiful harbour city pier is Amelia Hong Kong, with an unforgettable AYCE experience. Although I\u2019ve been to a few buffets, none are quite like Amelia\u2019s offerings. With the quality and cooked-to-order setting, it is insured that food comes warm and fresh. In addition, I\u2019ve never had an experience where they had all these offerings - free flow.\r\n\r\nMy personal favourite here was the Alaskan King Crab Leg. With legs that come out almost as big as my forearm, it served plenty of juicy flavourful crab meat. I can confidently say that this was the most \u201cAlaskan King Crab Legs\u201d that I have eaten in one sitting! \u2014 Ryan Putranto, Multimedia Editor\r\n\r\nShop OT G63, Ground Floor, Ocean Terminal, Harbour City, 3-27 Canton Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong\r\nPrince and the Peacock\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dish: Murgh Makhanwala - Braised chicken, tomato, butter (HK$198)\r\n\r\nQuite possibly the best butter chicken I\u2019ve had. Ever.\r\n\r\nLocated in the historic Magistracy, is Prince and the Peacock, serving up a royal Indian experience. From the furnishings, to the lighting, to the menu, it is clear that the restaurant values details and how it contributes to the overall dining experience.\r\n\r\nOne thing I really enjoyed about my experience at the Prince and the Peacock was the staff explaining each dish and the story behind it. The menu has a lot of lore behind the empires, kingdoms, tribes and how it influenced the culinary offerings of India. To the best of my knowledge, this was the first time I\u2019ve seen a menu with a glossary. All this history in the dishes gave me more appreciation for the dish and the ability to pick out certain flavours and understand how they came to be.\r\n\r\nAnd circling it back to the Murgh Makhanwala, my best bite of the restaurant. Braised with tomato, and heralded as the \u201cOriginal\u201d butter chicken, this was truly unlike any other butter chicken I\u2019ve had (and I\u2019ve had a lot). The flavours were rich yet light. The chicken soaked in curry simply dissolved from how tender it was. Pairing well with the butter naan or rice, I couldn\u2019t get enough of this dish. \u2014 Ryan Putranto, Multimedia Editor\r\n\r\n2\/F, Central Magistracy, Tai Kwun, 1 Arbuthnot Rd, Central, Hong Kong"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Silk. begins its global expansion with first boba shop in Singapore","position":29,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/drinks\/silk-hong-kong-boba-brand-singapore-opening-info\/","description":"Silk., a boba brand described as \"Hong Kong's Best-Kept Secret\" and Volvic Asia's first and only official premium tea partner, officially opened its first international location in Singapore on October 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Loving The Good Food \u2615\ufe0f (@sgcafehopping)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving partnered with the likes of Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Johnnie Walker, ComplexCon, and 88rising's Head in the Clouds festival in New York in which it sold a record 8,000 cups in 48 hours, Silk. has grown into a cultural marque leading the third wave of the tea market.

As one of the judges of Culinary Class Wars, the Korean chef charmed audiences with his personality and skills. Although he initially wanted to work as a mechanic after serving in the U.S. Army, a chance encounter led him towards culinary school.\r\n\r\nHe apprenticed at fine dining restaurants before opening his own restaurant in San Fransisco where he grew up. Eventually, he brought this restaurant to South Korea and named it Mosu, after the cosmos flower field that grew near his childhood home. Since then, he has earned three MICHELIN stars for Mosu Seoul. In 2022, he opened Mosu Hong Kong, led by Head Chef Jeong Jin-hwan (Bruno) in his stead.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Chef Jimmy Lim's name is just as prestigious. At 41 years old, he became the first Singaporean to be awarded three MICHELIN stars. His restaurant, JL Studio, is also the first Singaporean restaurant to receive that recognition. As the son of a chef, Lim always had an interest in cooking.\r\n\r\nHe was actually pursuing a professional basketball career until an injury forced him to shift focus and turn to cooking instead. Through that experience, he realised his aptitude for the culinary scene, following in the steps of his dad. Eventually, in 2017, Lim opened his own restaurant in Taichung, where he had worked as a chef for eight years. Six years later, he finally earned his third MICHELIN star, boosting Singaporean cuisine to the international stage.\r\n\r\nExperience the mastery of the two chefs in the upcoming Mosu Hong Kong x JL Studio four-hand dinner on November 30 and December 1.\r\n\r\nLocation: Mosu Hong Kong, 3\/F, M+, 38 Museum Drive, West Kowloon Cultural District, Kowloon\r\n\r\n(Images: Lai Sun Dining \/ Mosu Hong Kong \/ JL Studio)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Honouring a 200th anniversary with The Glenlivet 55","position":35,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/honouring-a-200th-anniversary-with-the-glenlivet-55\/","description":"Ladies, gentlemen and digital influencers, when was the last time you experienced a sit-down dinner inside a Scottish whisky distillery and its lantern-shaped stills, and were serenaded by bagpipers on your way into the venue, and DJ\u2019s post-dinner? Aye. Most likely never, because this was a first in the history of Scotch whisky in Speyside, north Scotland, commemorating the remarkable 200-year legacy and innovative spirit inimitable to The Glenlivet, and its founder George Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd such was the pioneering thrill as Lifestyle Asia joined the buzzy throng of expectant whisky connoisseurs and appreciators in September at The Glenlivet Estate\u2019s distillery, to taste exclusively the highest vintage the house has ever released: The Glenlivet Eternal Collection, First Edition, 55 Year Old single malt. As befits such a historic release, only 100 bottles of the limited-edition single malt can be purchased \u2014 at a retail price of EUR 50,000 \u2014 and orders are limited to one bottle per customer.\r\n\r\nHowever, for hyper-discerning cognoscenti, there is a one-off, The Glenlivet 55 Year Old, 200th Anniversary Edition, one-of-one, (bottled at 42.8%, a higher strength than the house\u2019s standard 55 Year Old release) and created in collaboration with computational architect Michael Hansmeyer, who has designed a sculpture consisting of 24-carat gold plating and pav\u00e9 set with 37 Peridots in a pure silver cowl with enamel decoration.\r\n\r\nThis bespoke single whisky lot will be auctioned by Sotheby\u2019s from October 18 \u2013 November 1, 2024. To register early interest in the one-of-one auction, click here. All proceeds will benefit National Trust for Scotland, which is dedicated to conserving Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning after the 55 Year Old the night before (the long-lasting experience of its rich-ness still creating a standing ovation on our palates), we were steeped in some of this evocative history. Archaeologists recently discovered the ruins of the original Glenlivet distillery from 1824. George Smith had once made illicit single-malt whisky at the site and smuggled it to his customers. After gaining a licence in 1823, Smith converted the site into a legal whisky distillery. Today, only two small dams remain above ground.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised and delighted to discover the National Trust for Scotland on a historic dig at the site in tandem with The Glenlivet. So far, fragments of glass, and scatterings of ceramic have been excavated and all inventoried. Brands in the luxury sector talk up their histories and provenance, but here we were atop the hills, in the pristine blue sky breathing crisp, bracing Speyside air, protagonists, guardians, and witnesses to living history with the site\u2019s infinite secrets and a view to match. In the dram of that magical moment, we were Indiana Jones and the Temple of The Glenlivet. Go get thee to The Glenlivet \u2014 and indeed to Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 and indulge those 55 Year Old drops of living history to your libatory content.

From Wa-En Kappo offering delights, comfort, and nostalgic flavours with every bite to  The Mira's Cuisine Cuisine celebrating the sublime autumnal delicacy within an eight-course feast \u2013 the city's dining experiences are par excellence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best hairy crab spots in Hong Kong 2024"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"La Petite Maison presents new business lunch menu and private dining room","position":39,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/la-petite-maison-business-lunch-menu-private-dining-room-details-prices-info\/","description":"La Petite Maison has been the talk of the town since reopening in September, and now it's launching a new business lunch set.

Check out Moo-Lah, the new concept from the same team behind Born & Bred in Seoul. Specialising in Korean Hanwoo beef, the restaurant presents local recipes with this premium ingredient. The restaurant is now in its soft opening stage at Hollywood Road in Central.\r\n\r\nJung Sang-won, the founder of Seoul's Born & Bred (#64 in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2024 and Michelin-recommended), is bringing his expertise and love for Hanwoo beef to Hong Kong. \u201cBringing Moo-Lah to Hong Kong is a dream come true,\u201d he says. \u201cI am excited to share the incredible flavours of Hanwoo beef while honouring the city\u2019s culinary traditions. ...We are eager to create memorable dining experiences that unite top quality ingredients from Born & Bred with authentic recipes which I believe will be familiar flavours for Hong Kong and overseas guests.\u201d\r\nCarefully selected Korean Hanwoo beef\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn & Bred prides itself on its knowledge of Korean beef. The team brings that same level of expertise to Moo-Lah in Hong Kong. Unlike Japanese Wagyu which can be excessively fatty or American cattle that are overly lean, Hanwoo beef is perfectly balanced. Its unique marbling gives it a much-desired flavour and texture.\r\n\r\nMoo-Lah uses only the most premium Korean Hanwoo beef at grade 1++. This means that the meat is of exceptional quality and tenderness. The team also chooses only heifers (meaning cows that have borne only one or no calves) aged between 24\u2013months. The dishes use all parts of the cow, such as ribs, brisket, blade, shank, round, or tendons.\r\nSignature offerings at Moo-Lah\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, customers can enjoy lunch and dinner set menus at the restaurant. From 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. daily, guests can dine on a three-course lunch set menu starting from HK$168. The meal opens with a refreshing tomato salad. Next, diners can choose between four mains, each drawing inspiration from Hong Kong and prepared with Korean beef. Finally, close the meal with either the classic White Sugar Sponge Cake or Black Sesame Roll.\r\n\r\nThe dinner set is served daily from 6 to 10 p.m., starting from HK$268. It begins with the same tomato salad. Then, customers can choose from a beef satay bao with Hanwoo blade steak or Chinese Herb Spiced Hanwoo Beef Shank. After the appetizer is the Minced Hanwoo Beef Radish Cake in Gravy.\r\n\r\nFor the main course, guests can choose from five options. Those who prefer soupy dishes can try the Hanwoo Kalbi Short Rib Noodles in clear broth (HK$368), Assorted Hanwoo Beef in clear broth noodles (HK$338), or the Hanwoo Beef Brisket in clear broth noodles (HK$318). Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-style Beef Brisket Curry Rice (HK$288) or the Chargrilled Hanwoo Burger with Egg on Rice (HK$268) are perfect for those who prefer something saucier. The meal concludes with the same choice of desserts available for lunch.\r\n\r\nAside from the existing set menus, Moo-Lah also plans to introduce a special late-night menu. This new menu might come as early as November. The team is also continuously developing and improving its menu offerings.\r\n\r\nLocation: G\/F, 66 Hollywood Road, Central\r\n\r\n(Images: Moo-Lah)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Staff Meals: Fireside","position":41,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/dining\/staff-meals-fireside\/","description":"Hong Kong is a city that is full of great, award-winning restaurants and chefs. While most are familiar with these restaurants as guests, few get to witness the type of food being served to staff. What\u2019s on the menu for those that work there? For the next instalment of our Staff Meals series, we visit Chef Jaime Ortol\u00e1 at Fireside to check out what multicultural dishes his team has prepared for their Staff Meals.\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DBaxoXPyR-6\/\r\n\r\nAt Fireside, the motto \u201cFire is Our Religion\u201d is taken very seriously. Whether it is grilling, charring, or smoking, the core of it starts with fire. Known for its delicious steaks cooked in an open-fire setting, the restaurant has a fitting wooden aroma that pairs well with the menu items. This passion for fire even extends over to their Staff Meals.\r\n\r\nExecutive chef Jaime Ortol\u00e1 talks to us about how Staff Meals are actually a good opportunity for the staff to train and hone their techniques with the fire. Even the floor staff will be cooking steaks for the Staff Meals so that they can have a better understanding of the flavour profiles of what they\u2019re serving and the techniques that go into the cooking process. Steaks that have oxidized and aren\u2019t good for selling (but still good for eating) will be cooked every two (or so) Staff Meals. The staff at Fireside will often review these steaks to give each other more feedback on how to tame the fire in the journey of cooking the perfect steak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough not every Staff Meal will have steaks, most of them are quite diverse. With a multicultural team, the staff at Fireside get to showcase meals from home and learn from each other. When we visited, Chef Jaime prepared a Chicken Paella, a dish he has cooked since childhood. With techniques mastered over the years, this is a dish he was very comfortable making. However, for the team, he makes it with a Fireside twist. Cooking on top of burning wood, Chef Jaime says this is a technique used at the restaurant that helps the rice in his paella absorb a lot of the aromas.\r\n\r\nAccording to the chef, it is very important that his Staff Meals are balanced with veggies, carbs and proteins so that his staff can be energised through the evening service. For today\u2019s Staff Meal, Chef Jaime\u2019s Paella is paired with a Nepalese Dahl and Indonesian Salad giving the staff a very diverse and nutritious experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out our Staff Meals video above. Reservations to Fireside can be made here for lunch and dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFireside\r\n\r\n5th floor, H Code\r\n\r\n45 Pottinger St,\r\n\r\nCentral, Hong Kong\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVideo: Ryan Putranto\r\n\r\nGaffer: Samson Jr De Guzman\r\n\r\nProducer: Ambrose Leung\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks: Robin Smith"}]}</script>      <meta name="onesignal" content="wordpress-plugin">
