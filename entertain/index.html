season 2 ending explained: Is this the end for Jinx and Vi?","position":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/streaming\/arcane-season-2-netflix-ending-explained\/","description":"A brainchild of Christian Linke and Alex Yee, members of Riot\u2019s player support team, Arcane is one of the biggest and most critically acclaimed animated series of all time. The first season blew away fans and critics alike, taking home four Emmy Awards in 2022, including Outstanding Animated Program. Needless to say, fans had major expectations from Arcane season 2. One can argue that season 2 progressed at a much faster rate. Due to the interesting plot lines and enough screen time for every character, it was entertaining to watch everyone unfold so rapidly. In this article, we have explored the poignant ending of Arcane Season 2 and explained what it means for the future of the series.\r\n\r\nSeason 2 may not be able to surpass Arcane season 1. Many of the subplots were not fleshed out and developed to the fullest. The narration was quite rushed. The incredibly beautiful animation and skilled dialogue writing remain consistent throughout the second season. The ending was epic but quite open-ended. Before the curtain falls, we hear Caitlyn say, \u201cOur story isn't over\u201d. So what's in store for the League of Legends fans and the future of the Netflix series Arcane?\r\n\r\nLet's explore the open-ended finale of Arcane season 2, Act III \u2014 from Jinx meeting her traumatic fate to Victor being consumed by the Hextech he once wanted to destroy.\r\nArcane season 2 ending explained: What happens in Act III?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Arcane (@arcaneshow)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct III in Arcane season 2 consists of three episodes \u2014 Pretend Like It's The First Time, Killing Is A Cycle and The First Under Your Nails. Heimerdinger and Ekko end up in a different timeline where Hextech was never invented, Zaun is a Utopia, Jinx is Powder (Now all grown up) and Vi is dead. While Heimerdinger seems perfectly content, Ekko realises the need to return to his original timeline. Together, they build a time machine which later plays a huge part in stringing the end of Arcane Season 2. The machine goes back in time by four seconds, emulating his ultimate ability from\u00a0League of Legends.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jayce lands in a dystopian timeline where Piltover has turned into dust. He sees the grim future of his city caused by the Hextech should he fail to stop Victor in time. He traverses the Hextech-Vault-like world with great difficulty to meet the man who once presented the Hextech to him. This mysteriously cloaked man turns out to be Victor.\r\nVander returns!\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5284275\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Image: Courtesy Arcane 2\/ IMDb[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhen all hope seemed lost for the sisters, their only mentor and the man they cared the most about, returns alive albeit in an inhuman form. Jinx is the first one to encounter Vander in a beastly form. She reaches out to Vi to join forces with her to track down Vander. The sisters along with Isha take him to Herald The Healer aka Victor. After examining him, Victor decides to take the risk to bring Vander's psyche back from the beast on one condition \u2014 he must be retrained at night for he poses a great threat to the people of Zaun as a beast. The sisters agree. Thus begins Victor and Sky's journey to heal Vander. They dive deep into his memories with Vi and her parents, his vision of a utopia in Zaun and more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ambessa and Dr. Reveck team up to capture Vandar's Warwick to their advantage. Their plans are cut short after Caitlyn and Vi reunite and join forces to save Vander. With a clever and quiet tactic, Vi manages to dismantle Ambessa while Caitlyn captures Dr. Reveck. However, in a series of unfortunate events, Jayce strikes Victor, destroying his peaceful commune and ending all possibility of curing Vander. It ensues a war as Warwick gets out of control. While Jinx tries to save Vander, Ambessa's army tries to capture him to use him as a weapon in the war. Jinx watches in horror as Isha sacrifices herself. Additionally, she witnesses Vander being pulled away from her. This seems to be the final straw in her traumatic journey.\r\nMel discovers her true legacy\r\nAfter being attacked by the \"Black Rose\", Mel goes MIA into oblivion for a long time where she confronts her true heritage. She is revealed to be the sister of Arcane's Black Rose and a powerful wage. She discovers her true powers that have been running through her veins and finally embraces them to go against her mother and her dangerous ideology. Along with Caitlyn, she takes on Ambessa in close combat. Their battle ends with Mel being declared as \"The Wolf\". This could be a powerful set-up for an Arcane spin-off on Mel and her legacy.\r\nVictor vs Jayce\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5284277\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Image: Courtesy Arcane 2\/ IMDb[\/caption]\r\n\r\nACT III starts centring around Victor. He seems to be the thread pulling everyone together. He forms a cult-like community of the people he healed, including Vander as Warwick. He becomes an omnipresent entity that just doesn't seem to ever die and keeps popping up now and then. His priorities shift from destroying the Hextech to being consumed by it. He wants everyone to be of one mind and rid them of their choices that lead to corruption, greed and death. He emerged as a biblical figure who wanted to attain the ultimate evolution for humans. He joins forces with Ambessa who has her own motives \u2014 one that would destroy Piltover \u2014 and her Noxian army.\r\n\r\nIronically, his plan to unite everyone's subconscious mind into one became the very reason behind the warring nations, Piltover and Zaun, to reunite and fight against a common foe. With the help of Ekko, Jayce manages to stop Victor, helping everyone to get out of his trance. Even towards the end, Jayce never leaves Victor and helps him escape the trance of Hextech. Jayce finally embraces his League of Legends subtitle: The Defender of Tomorrow.\r\nIs Jinx dead?\r\nIn a showdown, Jinx, Vi and Vander get into a scuffle. After Victor's trance wears off, The trio fall onto the ledges. Jinx tries to convince Vi to leave Vander before the ledge falls off, killing them both. As Vi gets emotional, Warwick awakens and tries to kill Vi. Jinx meddles, pushing Warwick along with her to death. She detonates the bomb and embraces Vander one last time before falling to her death. While we can see Vi mourn her, we don't see Jinx's body. Therefore, it is not far-fetched to assume that Jinx may have somehow survived her own bomb. Meanwhile, Vi and Caitlyn reconcile and find comfort in each other's grief.\r\nWill there be Arcane Season 3?\r\nThough it was initially budgeted for a five-season arc, a report from Variety suggests that season 2 is all the fans are going to get from Riot Games's League of Legends series. The reasoning seems to be budgeting as it cost USD 250 million for the company to produce 18 episodes, making it the most expensive animated series ever on streaming or linear TV.\r\n\r\n(Hero Image and feature image: Courtesy Arcane 2\/Netflix)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Scandals and controversies that shook the K-pop industry this year","position":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/k-pop-controversies-2024\/","description":"\r\nThe entertainment industry can appear dazzling and full of hope, but beneath the surface, the reality is often more complex. In the past few years, K-Pop has become a global phenomenon, with groups like BTS and BLACKPINK as well as multiple solo artists entering the global charts and selling out shows worldwide. However, in 2024, the K-Pop industry has been rattled by a number of major controversies and scandals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis year, headlines have been dominated by scandals, from BTS member Suga\u2019s DUI case to the ADOR and Min Hee-jin drama, and even the controversy surrounding Riize\u2019s Seunghan. K-pop began to claim the global spotlight around 2018 to 2019, and during the pandemic, the world\u2019s fascination with K-culture expanded to include not only K-pop but also K-dramas, K-beauty, and K-fashion. But 2024 has highlighted a darker side to the industry, leading many to question if the world of K-Pop is facing a crisis. Here are some of the most significant scandals that have made waves this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The article contains sensitive topics that might upset some readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nK-pop scandals and controversies that made headlines in 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer NCT member Taeil\u2019s SA scandal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Moon Taeil (@stronytaeil)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoon Tae-il, 30 who was a member of the K-pop boy group NCT quit the band in August 2024 after being charged with a \u201ccriminal case related to a sexual crime\u201d. Taeil began his music career back in 2013, and soon after, was discovered by SM Entertainment. In 2016, he made his debut with the boy group NCT and was active under the subgroup NCT 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaeil is no longer a member of NCT. We will no longer be supporting him due to the crimes he\u2019s being accused of. We hope the victims are doing well and have the support that they need at this time. https:\/\/t.co\/Ffy5zkNpjP\r\n\u2014 NCT Updating (@NCTupdating) August 28, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 28, SM Entertainment issued a statement indicating the singer had decided to leave the boyband in the wake of his offenses, and that he would no longer participate in the group's activities. The label added that the accused artist is cooperating with the investigation. It was later revealed that he is under investigation for aggravated quasi-rape. According to sources, the alleged victim is a non-celebrity foreign national who was unconscious and intoxicated when the South Korean musician and two of his acquaintances supposedly sexually assaulted her. The label has also officially terminated its contract with the artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ADOR-HYBE drama\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Images: hitmanb72 and min.hee.jin\/Instagram)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ADOR-HYBE feud or Bang Si-hyuk and Min Hee-jin drama is one for the history book. South Korean entertainment company HYBE is the parent company of multiple successful music labels, including Big Hit Entertainment, Source Music, Belift Lab, ADOR and more. Of note, ADOR manages rising K-pop girl group NewJeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA power trip?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power battle first became public in April 2024, when HYBE launched an internal audit for ADOR over suspicions that they were attempting to seize control of the K-pop agency. However, no names were mentioned. But after the news leaked, ADOR CEO Min Hee Jin issued a statement, stating that HYBE is trying to undermine NewJeans' success. She further accused HYBE and its other subsidiary Belift Lab of copying \u201cmakeup, costumes, choreography, photos, videos and event appearances\u201d of NJ for their new girl group ILLIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBE CEO Park Ji-won claims to have discovered evidence of Min and other executives \u201ctrying to seize control\u201d of ADOR. Min and other ADOR executives denied the accusations. She held a press conference where she stated that she feels like the company took advantage of her, saying, \u201c[the company] used me to the fullest and now wants to take me down because I don\u2019t listen to them\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMin further said that HYBE asked her \u201cnot to promote NewJeans before LE SSERAFIM\u2018s debut, because they wanted people to think that LE SSERAFIM was Min Hee-jin\u2019s girl group\u201d. The day after the press conference, HYBE issued a statement to refute Min's claims, alleging, \u201cso much [of what Min claimed during the press conference] is far from the truth to the point that it is difficult to go through them one by one\u201d. HYBE further claimed that it \u201ccan refute all claims with evidence\u201d. In the statement, HYBE also asked Min to \u201cresign promptly for the proper management of ADOR as she has already proven herself unfit to be in charge of management\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLawsuits and MHJ stepping down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Belift Lab, the HYBE subsidiary that houses ILLIT, sued Min Hee-jin for defamation over plagiarism allegations. On May 31, 2024, MHJ held a second press conference regarding the future of ADOR and NewJeans. Interestingly, a few days later, another HYBE subsidiary, Source Music, which is the label of LE SSERAFIM, filed a lawsuit against Min, seeking KRW 500 million (about USD 360,000) in damages for defamation. On Aug 27 2024, Min stepped down as CEO of ADOR against her wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewJeans\u2019 reaction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of NewJeans expressed their frustration over the whole situation on social media, voicing their support of MHJ. Some of their fans also wrote a letter to HYBE asking them to reinstate Min Hee Jin as the CEO of ADOR. On September 11 2024, all five members of NJs did an impromptu live stream (now deleted) on their YT channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the livestream, the girl group alleged that HYBE had been \u201cbullying\u201d Min, saying that they \u201cfeel so bad\u201d for the music executive. \u201cHYBE just seems like an inhumane company. What are we supposed to learn from such a company?\u201d said Danielle. \"We hope that HYBE makes the wise choice to reinstate Min Hee-jin as the CEO of ADOR by September 25,\" said Minji. \u201cThe ADOR that we want is an ADOR where the music production and company management are done by Min Hee-jin as the CEO. We make this request as the way to cohabitate peacefully with HYBE.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did BTS get involved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Bam's dad (@bowwow_bam)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBTS is the oldest and most successful group under HYBE. Yonhap News reported that HYBE\u2019s April audit found that Min Hee-jin privately told other people that Bang Si-hyuk had copied her to make BTS. Understandably, the fans of BTS, the BTS ARMY, did not take the news well. For her part, Min has denied ever saying this during her press conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a supernatural note, HYBE has also released messages exchanged between Min and a shaman. According to HYBE, Min, who felt that the shaman was possessed by her deceased sister, had spoken on business issues such as who to recruit and which trainees to choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, what truly landed Min in hot water was her alleged comments on BTS's military duties. \u201cI think it would be better for me if BTS went, what do you think?\u201d Min reportedly remarked in her leaked chats, adding, \u201cI'm trying to send them.\u201d On hearing this, ARMYs were furious, and began to directly oppose MHJ in the ADOR-HYBE battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking out on the allegations at a press conference, Min attempting to clear the air by revealing that the shaman was just a friend. She added, \u201cI was tired of how HYBE was treating me, and I thought perhaps it would be better for us if HYBE\u2019s top act, BTS, were not active.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 13, a post appeared on the Instagram account of BTS Jungkook's dog, captioned, \u201cArtists are not guilty.\u201d The next day, a follow-up post read, \u201cDon't use them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another statement, Big Hit Music revealed that they had spoken with the BTS member and confirmed he put out the posts because he believed \u201cunder no circumstances should a young artist be dragged into a dispute and used as a shield.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMin claimed in an interview that V, with whom she collaborated on his debut solo album Layover, would occasionally check on her from the military to see how she was doing during the ongoing events. Netizens then protested that BTS V violated the military code by contacting someone from outside, and they reportedly asked that the situation be thoroughly probed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBTS Suga\u2019s DUI Case\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by SUGA of BTS \ubbfc\uc724\uae30 (@agustd)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 6 2024, BTS member Suga was arrested by authorities for driving an electric scooter while intoxicated. He was near his home in Yongsan district\u2019s Hannam area. According to the police, his breathalyser test revealed that his blood alcohol level was 0.227 percent at the time, well above the legal limit of 0.08 percent, warranting the cancellation of his licence. The next day, the rapper posted an apology on Weverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 16, protest trucks surrounded the HYBE headquarters, demanding Suga's removal from BTS. The signs on the cars said \u201c7-1=6.\u201d \u201cThe army will fill the gap, so drunk driver, SUGA OUT.\u201d While the initial assumption was that the protests were organised by angry fans, it was later revealed that one NCT fan may have organised the whole thing. While some Netizens criticised the musician for his bad decision making, the majority of ARMYs (BTS fans) have risen to his defense. Several Korean celebs have also expressed their support for the artist. Suga has pleaded guilty to the DUI allegations, and the prosecution has agreed to release him with a fine of USD 11,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRiize Seunghan dating rumours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by RIIZE SEUNGHAN (\uc2b9\ud55c) (@seunghan_riize)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September 2023, 21-year-old Seunghan made his debut as a member of RIIZE, which operates under SM Entertainment. Two months later, the label placed him on temporary hiatus. After a year, SM Ent. acknowledged his return to the group, but fan (or rather anti-fan) protests caused the K-pop idol to leave the group permanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idol was put on hiatus after some of his pre-debut pics and videos surfaced online a month before the debut of Riize. In the post, Seunghan was shown kissing a woman in bed and smoking a cigarette, leading conservative Korean fans to condemn him for his actions. While these actions may seem fairly normal in today\u2019s society, some conservative Korean fans remain critical of such actions. Moreover, labels encourage a parasocial relationship between idols and fans, which leads to many \u2018delulu\u2019 fans believing they actually have a say in their idols' personal lives. Reportedly, many of these entertainment labels have a no dating policy for their artists. Early this year, we saw the hate trail some of these \u2018fans\u2019 started when Aespa\u2019s Karina and actor Lee Jae Wook started dating. As a result of the backlash, the couple parted ways soon after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis kind of behaviour is becoming a regular in the K-pop scene. From fans sending funeral wreaths at the slightest inconvenience and criticising artists online for smoking to turning on the idols and their partners for dating and sending death threats \u2014 this dark side of K-pop has proven harmful for both the artists as well as the fans' mental health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October 2024, SM officially announced the return of Seunghan in a social media post dedicated to BRIIZE (RIIZE\u2019s fandom). Even though international fans were excited for Seunghan's return, Korean fans weren\u2019t so happy about the news, with a few K-fans even banding together to send around 1,000 funeral wreaths to SM Entertainment. Some extremists even sent death threats to the singer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIIZE\u2019s \u2018OT6 fans\u2019 argued that Seunghan wasn't professional and had betrayed their trust by dating. Some also stated that his past scandals could affect the group\u2019s reputation. While Riize member Wonbin stood up for his bandmate, the backlash proved too much to shoulder. Just two days after the return announcement, the label shared that Seunghan would be permanently leaving the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSM entertainment released another statement confirming Seunghan is preparing for a solo debut in 2025. \u201cSeunghan intends to showcase his talent and pursue his dreams revealing a new side of himself as a solo artist,\u201d the agency said.\r\nThis story first appeared here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"The next viral sensation from Thailand is a cute golden tiger cub named Ava","position":3,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/ava-golden-tiger-cub-thailand-viral-moo-deng-chiang-mai\/","description":"From the slippery moistness of Moo Deng, we now behold a furrier cute phenom: Ava, the golden tiger cub of Thailand.\r\n\r\nThailand is on a roll with these adorable animals.

Because of her beautiful fur and her innocent-looking expression, many have commented that she\u2019s like an overgrown kitten though we doubt anyone would want to be locked with her for even a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DCgOiszpVTp\/?img_index=1\r\n\r\nMuch like Moo Deng over at Khao Kheow Zoo, Ava and her sister Luna can be visited at Chiang Mai Night Safari.

Through clever metaphors and dialogue drawn from real-life experience, it has brought a lupe to Asians in Hollywood. Here\u2019s a closer look.\r\nA \u201cmeta\u201d detective series in which a struggling Asian waiter becomes the unlikely hero of a police procedural-style criminal conspiracy, Interior Chinatown satirises Hollywood's stereotypical treatment of minorities \u2014 while also nodding to the progress the industry has belatedly made.\r\nThe new show, out on Hulu (Disney+ in Hong Kong), is based on the critically adored novel by US author Charles Yu, who is of Taiwanese descent.\r\n\r\nHow Interior Chinatown satirises Asians in Hollywood: Metaphors, irony, and real-life experience\r\n\r\nYu's 2020 bestseller delivered a humorous takedown of racism in US society through the adventures of Willis Wu, a Hollywood extra reduced to playing roles like \u201cBackground Oriental Male\u201d but who dreams of one day being promoted to \u201cKung Fu Guy.\u201d\r\nYu now serves as the TV series' creator and showrunner.\r\n\u201cI grew up watching TV in the '80s and '90s, and I just never saw Asians on TV. It's as if they didn't exist,\u201d he told a press conference in July.\r\n\u201cThey existed in real life when I'd go outside, but they weren't somehow in my screen. And so, that sort of shaped me in wanting to tell this story.\u201d\r\nEven a decade ago, Yu's literary creation would likely have been ignored by Hollywood.\r\nBut in recent years, breakout successes for Asian American productions like Crazy Rich Asians and Everything Everywhere All At Once, not to mention South Korean hits Parasite and Squid Game, have proven the commercial appetite for diverse storytelling.\r\nHong Kong-born US actor Jimmy O. Yang, who appeared in Crazy Rich Asians, stars as Wu in Interior Chinatown. Oscar-winning New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi (of Jojo Rabbit) directs the pilot episode.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5284030\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Image credit: Disney+[\/caption]\r\nInterior Chinatown\u00a0is a metaphor for something greater\r\nViewers are introduced to Wu as an ordinary waiter at a restaurant in Los Angeles's Chinatown \u2014 but quickly find out that he also appears to reside within a police procedural.\r\nIn these scenes, Interior Chinatown adopts the visual codes and tropes of a TV cop drama. Wu is relegated to a background character role, as the series' Black and white cop duo solve crimes. Even more strangely, unexplained cameras are shown filming Wu and his colleagues, reminiscent of The Truman Show.\r\nThe distortion of reality echoes the premise of the original novel, which was itself written in the form of a television screenplay. \u201cIt's such a great metaphor for what it means to be Asian American in this country,\u201d said Yang.\r\n\u201cBut at the same time, it's a universal story of someone longing to be more, someone finding themselves in their career.\u201d\r\nWhen Wu witnesses a kidnapping, twists and turns see this background actor take on increasingly important roles in the narrative of criminal intrigue.\u201cHe moves on to be kind of like a guest star. And then the tech guy, which, of course, I played before. So it really drew a lot of parallels to my own career,\u201d said Yang.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283971\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Valerie Macon\/AFP\u00a9[\/caption]\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just not white enough to lead, but you\u2019re not Asian enough to be Asian\u201d\r\nThe series blends English, Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue. Among its characters is Lana Lee, a mixed-race novice cop, who is assigned a case in Chinatown by superiors who incorrectly assume that she must know her way around the Asian neighbourhood.\r\nThe irony was not lost on actress Chloe Bennet, born Chloe Wang to a Chinese father and white American mother, who in real life had to change her last name in order to land roles in Hollywood.\r\n\u201cMy journey through the industry is so meta for Lana,\u201d she told the press conference.\r\n\u201cI literally was told at the beginning of my career... \u2018You're just not white enough to be the lead, but you're not Asian enough to be the Asian.\u2019\u201d\r\nWu's best friend Fatty Choi, played by comedian Ronny Chieng (of The Daily Show), provides a hilarious counterpoint to audiences' pre-conceived notions of Asians as the \u201cmodel minority.\u201d\r\nA video game-addicted stoner, Choi aggressively lectures the restaurant's demanding white customers that they are \u201cnot the centre of the universe.\u201d\r\n\u201cTo do something this cool, this meta, this mind-bending and smart \u2014 social commentary, but not hitting people over the head with it... this is the stuff that you only dream of being able to do,\u201d he said.\r\nInterior Chinatown is available to stream on Disney+ in Hong Kong.\r\nThis story is published via AFP Relaxnews.

Given Scott's keeping up with pace, Gladiator 3 could be coming to theatres in the next few years.\r\nCast of Gladiator 3: What to expect\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283868\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Denzel Washington in Gladiator 2. (Image: Courtesy of Cuba Scott\/Cuba Scott - \u00a9 2024 Paramount Pictures\/IMDb)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe cast of Gladiator 3 is yet to be confirmed. Still, there are strong indications about who might return and what fresh faces could be expected in the franchise. Paul Mescal, playing the role of Lucius, is very likely to reprise his role as the main lead in the movie. Having survived the dramatic events of Gladiator 2, Lucius's journey seems to be a long way as he is going to face the problems of leadership and the troubles of power. Mescal has already indicated interest in returning for another sequel, so his participation is well nigh certain.\r\n\r\nAs for Denzel Washington, his character did die in Gladiator 2, but he could still appear in flashbacks or metaphors since Ridley Scott likes that sometimes. Similarly, several new faces are definitely going to appear, since the series has consistently brought huge stars like Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn into supporting roles. The first movie Oscar-winner Joaquin Phoenix in a villainous role. Phoenix, by the way, also starred in Scott's own Napoleon (2023). Fans can expect another stellar ensemble as the cast of Gladiator 3, blending familiar faces with fresh talent carrying the legacy forward.\r\nGladiator 3 potential release date\r\nWhile nothing is etched in stone, Ridley Scott's excitement seems to indicate that filming of this third instalment in the epic action movie franchise may begin sooner rather than later. Assuming a similar shooting schedule as Gladiator 2, which began filming in June 2023 and ended by January 2024, Gladiator 3 could be on a similar timeline as well. The movie\u00a0on the big screen may materialise as early as 2026 or 2027.\r\nIs there a trailer for Gladiator 3 yet?\r\nNo, sadly, since the movie is still in pre-production, there is no Gladiator 3 trailer yet. And it might be a while before we see it. You can, in the meanwhile, make do with Gladiator 2 trailer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy of Aidan Monaghan\/Aidan Monaghan - \u00a9 2024 PARAMOUNT PICTURES.

The actor's enigmatic charm remains palpable even in his 40s as a combined result of his great body of work and graceful ageing.\r\n\r\nKnown for his uncompromising dedication to his craft, Hardy's inclination towards peculiar accents, disguises and idiosyncrasies has served him well in his Hollywood career spanning over 25 years.\u00a0Currently, gearing up for his upcoming release Venom: The Last Dance or Venom 3, the final movie in his iconic superhero franchise, Hardy has given us multiple memorable performances since his striking debut in 2001 with Black Hawk Down.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNot just that; Hardy has been tirelessly working across various mediums, including TV and stage productions and has left audiences in awe with his performances in shows like Peaky Blinders (2014\u20132022) and Taboo (2017). \r\n\r\nHowever, in this listicle, we will restrict our focus to Tom Hardy\u2019s best movies over the years that have made him a household name and a hot favourite of legendary filmmakers like Christopher Nolan.\r\nTom Hardy's best movies and performances over the years\r\nHere's our carefully curated list of 15 of Tom Hardy's best movies, meticulously ranked on the strength of his performances.\r\n1. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283694\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Mad Max: Fury Road[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: George Miller\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult\r\nIMDb rating: 8.1\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\r\n\r\nFirst up on the list of Tom Hardy\u2019s best movies, we have the 2015 film Mad Max: Fury Road, where he took on the iconic role of Max Rockatansky. It follows Rockatansky as he joins forces with Imperator Furiosa (Theron) to rise against cult leader Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne). \r\n\r\nNotably, Hardy successfully embodied the character, previously portrayed by Mel Gibson, in this high-octane sequel.\u00a0He brought a unique touch to the character, incorporating various accents and mannerisms. \r\n\r\nHis portrayal showcased his exceptional physical acting skills, with Max often communicating through grunts rather than words. While Charlize Theron shone as the film's emotional core, Hardy's performance made them one of the most memorable action duos in recent cinema history.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n2. The Revenant (2015)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283696\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/The Revenant[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\r\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Tom Hardy\r\nIMDb rating: 8.0\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 78%\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 2015 was clearly Tom Hardy's year with back-to-back hits. He received his first Academy Award nomination for his role as Fitzgerald in The Revenant, which also starred Leonardo DiCaprio. In this blockbuster, Hardy portrayed the villainous trapper who betrays the leader Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), setting off a brutal quest for revenge after leaving him for dead and killing his son. \r\n\r\nOnce again, Hardy showcased his talent with a unique accent inspired by Tom Berenger's character in Platoon (1986). His performance was chilling and unpredictable, capturing the cold and untamed nature of the wilderness around him. \r\n\r\nDiCaprio also won an Oscar for his role as a fur trader fighting for survival after a bear attack and being abandoned by his team in the film.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n3. Locke (2013)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283699\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Locke[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Steven Knight\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Olivia Colman, Ruth Wilson, Andrew Scott\r\nIMDb rating: 7.1\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\r\n\r\nLocke is one of Tom Hardy\u2019s best movies in terms of performance. It reveals a side of him that had been overshadowed by his previous famous roles. Hardy portrayed Ivan Locke, a British construction manager in the story which unfolds through a continuous shot of him driving his car, resembling a dashcam. \r\n\r\nThroughout the journey, Locke engages in conversations with the important people in his life using his hands-free mobile. Despite being a reliable and composed individual, Locke unexpectedly abandons his responsibilities at a construction site in the Midlands and heads towards London due to a marital crisis and emotional breakdown. \r\n\r\nHardy's remarkable performance was characterised by subtlety and restraint. His acting can be likened to that of Richard Burton, yet it remains uniquely his own. This film truly showcases Hardy's talent at its finest.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n4. Warrior (2011)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283701\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Warrior[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Gavin O\u2019Connor\r\nCast: Joel Edgerton, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison, Frank Grillo, Tom Hardy\r\nIMDb rating: 8.1\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 84%\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating a successful sports movie can be challenging, as it is important to strike a balance and avoid becoming overly sentimental. When Warrior was released in 2011, there were doubts about its quality due to the relatively new emergence of MMA fighting in mainstream media. However, this film stands out as one of the finest sports movies of the modern era. \r\n\r\nTom Hardy delivered a remarkable performance, embodying the physicality and skill of a genuine MMA fighter. The dynamic between his character's father, played by Nick Nolte, and his brother, portrayed by Joel Edgerton, added depth and emotional weight to the traditional sports movie formula. Despite initially underperforming at the box office, Warrior has since gained a well-deserved following.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n5. The Drop (2014)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283703\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/The Drop[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, James Gandolfini, Matthias Schoenaerts\r\nIMDb rating: 7.0\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 89%\r\n\r\nIn an adaptation of a story by Dennis Lehane, Hardy portrays Bob, a kind and ordinary individual who works at a bar owned by his intimidating cousin Marv (James Gandolfini). The bar serves as a drop point for Chechen gangsters' illicit cash. Bob's act of rescuing a puppy from a nearby trash can sets off a chain of dramatic and tragic events, showcasing his altruism and innocence. \r\n\r\nBob is a distinctive character in Hardy's repertoire, as he is inherently likeable and relatable, qualities that Hardy's face and style have typically resisted. Additionally, Bob is shown to be vulnerable, facing bullying from a local police officer and being accused of betraying the church.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n6. Legend (2015)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283705\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Legend[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Brian Helgeland\r\nCast:\u00a0Emily Browing, David Thewlis, Christopher Eccleston\r\nIMDb rating: 6.9\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 61%\r\n\r\nTom Hardy's portrayal of the Kray Brothers \u2013 identical twins Reggie and Ron \u2013 in this 2015 remake of the 1990 film The Krays showcases his versatility as an actor. He skillfully embodied the charming and creepy aspects of the notorious gangsters who ruled the 1960s London underworld, creating two distinct yet equally captivating characters. \r\n\r\nBy embracing the larger-than-life nature of the roles, Hardy delivered performances that are both memorable and fitting for the savage comedy of Legend. His portrayal of the near-mythical figures as exaggerated, hyper-masculine cartoons went on to prove his commitment to fully understanding and embodying the characters he plays.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n7. Inception (2010)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283707\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Inception[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\r\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page\r\nIMDb rating: 8.8\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 87%\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by the sci-fi legend Christopher Nolan, Inception created quite a buzz in 2010, with viewers loving its intricate science-fiction plot while others found themselves confused. Nolan's cerebral thriller takes audiences on a mind-bending journey, where DiCaprio portrays Cobb, an industrial espionage hacker, who specialises in infiltrating people's subconscious to steal valuable secrets. In this particular mission, Cobb orchestrates the inception of an idea that will dismantle a powerful business empire. \r\n\r\nHardy played Eames, a member of Cobb's team, known for his expertise in shape-shifting identity theft, a skill that proves invaluable in manipulating their adversaries. Hardy's performance in this role showcased a refined and captivating demeanour, highlighting his versatility as an actor. Inception received critical acclaim, earning a Best Picture nomination and winning four Oscars in technical categories.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n8. Bronson (2008)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283709\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Bronson[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Nicolas Winding Refn\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Kelly Adams, Luing Andrews\r\nIMDb rating: 7.0\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 75%\r\n\r\nBronson is regarded as one of the best movies starring Tom Hardy by many critics; a film that launched him into the league of top-tier actors. In a pivotal move, Hardy underwent a remarkable physical transformation, gaining 100lbs to embody the imposing presence reminiscent of Russell Crowe. This metamorphosis allowed him to convincingly portray the infamous British inmate Charles Bronson (originally named Michael Peterson), a lifelong prisoner whose eccentric delusions and inclination towards violence have kept him incarcerated for the past thirty years. \r\n\r\nThroughout the film, Bronson breaks the fourth wall, engaging the audience with a witty and sophisticated performance. Although unconventional, the film brings to light Hardy's exceptional talent in delivering a compelling portrayal of the titular character.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n9. Dunkirk (2017)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283711\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Dunkirk[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\r\nCast: Fionn Whitehead, Barry Keoghan, Mark Rylance, Harry Styles\r\nIMDb rating: 7.8\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 92%\r\n\r\nNext up in the list of best movies starring Tom Hardy, we have another Nolan masterpiece \u2013 Dunkirk. Set against the backdrop of World War II, Hardy is Farrier, one of the British soldiers who takes command after his superior is killed. Farrier, the lone RAF pilot engages the enemy overhead at almost suicidal risk: it\u2019s a role supercharged with significance considering how much the RAF was resented for a perceived failure to provide sufficient air cover during the evacuation. \r\n\r\nThe film received 8 Oscar nominations including Best Picture and bagged three awards.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n10. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283713\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1600\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/The Dark Knight Rises[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\r\nCast: Christian Bale, Joseph-Gordon Leavitt, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy\r\nIMDb rating: 8.4\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 87%\r\n\r\nIn the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises, Tom Hardy delivered a standout performance as the formidable Bane, a character that truly showcased his acting prowess. \r\n\r\nBane, the leader of a rebellious underground army, is a menacing figure with a heavy leather respirator covering his face. Despite the challenge of speaking through the mask, Hardy's portrayal of Bane was both captivating and intense, requiring viewers to pay close attention to decipher his words. Hardy's commitment to the role was evident, as he brought a powerful presence to the screen throughout the film.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n11. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283715\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Tomas Alfredson\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, John le Carr\u00e9, Bridget O'Connor, Peter Straughan\r\nIMDb rating: 7.0\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 84%\r\n\r\nHardy's performance in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy set him apart from the esteemed British actors in the stacked cast. Despite his mainstream breakthrough in Inception just a year prior, Hardy showcases a subdued sensitivity that contrasted with his later roles known for their intensity and physicality. \r\n\r\nAs Ricki Tarr, a modest field agent with a romantic disposition, Hardy portrayed a character driven by love for his Soviet contact, who holds vital information regarding a mole within British intelligence. Although a supporting character, Hardy's portrayal carries the emotional weight of a tormented protagonist and makes it one of the best movies starring Tom Hardy.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n12. Venom (2018)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283717\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Venom[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Ruben Fleischer\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed\r\nIMDb rating: 6.6\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 30%\r\n\r\nVenom was a superhero movie that had uncertain expectations, especially since it only had a loose connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, what MCU fans witnessed was a highly energetic film made even more impressive by Tom Hardy's extraordinary performance in a dual role. \r\n\r\nHardy portrayed both Eddie Brock, a journalist who finds himself in a dire situation, and the malevolent symbiote that has taken over his body. Throughout the movie, there are skillfully executed moments of physical comedy as Eddie Brock (Hardy\u2019s character) battles against the insatiable appetite of Venom, also portrayed by Hardy. Alongside this struggle, Eddie also attempts to mend his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams), providing the right dose of superhero drama and romance.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n13. Lawless (2012)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283719\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Lawless[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: John Hillcoat\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Jason Clarke, Guy Pearce\r\nIMDb rating: 7.2\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 67%\r\n\r\nTouted as one of the best Tom Hardy movies, Lawless is an intense Depression-era mob drama. \r\n\r\nHardy portrayed the stoic Forrest Bondurant, a bootlegger in Virginia whose sweater is in desperate need of a thorough cleaning. His calm and deliberate demeanour added a sense of stability to the film.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n14. Capone (2020)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283721\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1114\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/Capone[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Josh Trank\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Linda Cardellini, Noel Fisher, Matt Dillon, Kathrine Narducci\r\nIMDb rating: 4.7\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 40%\r\n\r\nCapone may not fit the mould of a \u2018great\u2019 movie in the traditional sense. Josh Trank's initial post-director jail project falls short as a biopic that fails to connect in its eccentricity and narrative. However, Hardy delivered a compelling performance as the syphilis-afflicted mobster in his final days, showcasing his versatility as an actor with his distinctive voice and mannerisms. \r\n\r\nWhile it may leave you questioning the film's direction, Hardy's portrayal is chilling and certainly sparks contemplation. So, performance-wise Capone is definitely one of Tom Hardy's best movies.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n15. The Reckoning (2003)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283723\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Picture Credits: IMDb\/The Reckoning[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDirector: Paul McGuigan\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Paul Bettany, Willem Dafoe, Brian Cox, Gina McKee, Simon McBurney\r\nIMDb rating: 6.4\/10\r\nRotten Tomatoes score: 39%\r\n\r\nIn the year 2003, Hardy ventured into uncharted territory by portraying a character that defied traditional gender norms in the peculiar film titled The Reckoning. Set in the 14th century, the story revolves around a group of travelling performers (led by Dafoe's character). \r\n\r\nAmong them is Straw (Hardy), who expertly embraces cross-dressing and meticulously applies lipstick before gracing the stage. Hardy's unwavering confidence in his masculinity shone through in this unique role, hailed to date by fans and critics alike.\r\n\r\nWatch here.\r\n\r\n(Header and feature image courtesy: IMDb\/Lawless\/Mad Max: Fury Road\/Locke)\r\n\r\nThis story first appeared here."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"\u2018Arcane season 2\u2019: Check out the full episode release schedule","position":13,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/streaming\/arcane-season-2-episode-release-schedule-netflix\/","description":"After Jinx does what she does best \u2014 launches a stolen Hextech gemstone at the Piltover council \u2014 at the end of Arcane season 1, the potential reunion between Piltover and Zaun is now far from reality.

Caitlyn's dynamic journey since the end of Arcane\u2019s first season is interesting, to say the least. From plotting revenge on Jinx after her mother's death to marching on the beats of Ambessa, Season 2, Act I, culminated in a dramatic moment for the complex character. While dealing with Silco's death, Jinx formed an unexpected alliance with Sevika. Meanwhile, Vi and Caitlyn tried to navigate their relationship while they clashed ideologically.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Viktor returned while exhibiting a dark side to him. His experimentation with Hextech led to his transformation. Jinx, too, follows the path of destruction as she struggles to deal with her trauma. Mel Medarda's mother, Ambessa, sunk in her paws into Piltover's politics, ruining its chances of resolving conflicts with Zaun. While Vi tries to find a way to protect her people, the twin cities descend into chaos and destruction. Meanwhile, her estranged sister, Jinx starts plotting her bold plan to cause more destruction. Act I and Act II of Arcane Season 2 raise the stakes for the characters in Act III. It will be interesting to see the choices of every character and how it affects the cities.\r\nWhen are episodes 7,8 and 9 of Arcane Season 2 out on Netflix?\r\nEpisodes 7, 8 and 9 will be released on 23 November 2024.

It revisits ancient Rome with once again a vengeance-filled story that explores the legacy of Maximus through his son, Lucius Verus. Set more than two decades after the original film, Gladiator 2 follows Lucius\u2019 journey from peaceful citizen to enslaved gladiator, where he wrestles with vengeance, loss, and the ideals his father upheld. The movie has an intense, symbolism-laden ending and perfectly sets up the third part. Here's a breakdown of the complicated ending of Gladiator 2, what it means for Lucius and what it means for the future of Rome, as well as know all about the cast, trailer, review, release date and more.\r\n\r\nThe original Gladiator, directed by venerated English filmmaker Ridley Scott, who returns to helm the sequel, is considered one of the greatest historical films of all time, on par with epics like Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Ben-Hur (1959). In Gladiator 2, Scott further examines power, corruption, and sacrifice in the gritty, grand vignette of ancient Rome. If Maximus's story in the first movie was of honour and redemption, then Lucius's in Gladiator 2\u00a0is of a man wrestling with an urge for revenge and the burden of his legacy.\r\n\r\nRidley Scott may best be known for the sci-fi horror franchise Alien, which he began with the very first movie in 1979 and went on to direct two more entries, Gladiator is still arguably his magnum opus.\r\n\r\nGladiator 2\u00a0cast features Paul Mescal in the lead role of Lucius. Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Denzel Washington, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, Derek Jacobi and Connie Nielsen in supporting roles.\r\nGladiator 2\u00a0ending explained: Lucius\u2019 path to vengeance and Rome\u2019s uncertain future\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283668\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal on Gladiator 2. (Image: Courtesy of Aidan Monaghan\/Aidan Monaghan - \u00a9 2024 Paramount Pictures\/IMDb)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSo what happens in Gladiator 2? We meet the son of Lucilla (Nielsen) and late Maximus (Russell Crowe), Lucius Verus, who has led an uneventful life in Numidia in northwest Africa with his wife, Arishat (Yuval Gonen). Kept out of the politics and tumult of Rome by his mother, Lucius has been under the radar with the unassuming name \"Hanno.\" However, his life is upended as the Roman army, led by General Marcus Acacius, played by Pedro Pascal, invades Numidia. The invasion results in Lucius\u2019 capture, the death of Arishat, and Lucius\u2019 subsequent sale into slavery.\r\n\r\nSince the events of the original Gladiator, Rome has been plunged deep into corruption and chaos and is ruled by two erratic co-emperors in Caracalla (Hechinger) and Geta (Quinn) (which is historically accurate). The emperors are a cruel, unstable pair. They are hungry for conquest yet devoid of the wisdom and vision that Maximus once fought for. It is this fractured Rome that stands in contrast to the journey of Lucius as he navigates a political landscape full of corruption, power plays, and betrayal.\r\nLucius\u2019 path to vengeance\r\nAfter his capture, Lucius is bought by Macrinus (Denzel Washington), a former slave turned gladiator trainer with ambitions to overthrow the emperors and claim Rome\u2019s power for himself. Now, Macrinus is a Machiavellian figure, carefully playing a long game, using Lucius as a pawn in his schemes while concealing his true intentions. The former slave sees in Lucius a valuable asset and encourages his thirst for revenge, shaping him into a tool against Acacius and eventually the emperors.\r\n\r\nIntroduced early on as a brutal Roman general, Acacius turns out to be morally complex (and it helps the character that an actor like Pedro Pascal is portraying it). He was once trained by Maximus and shares some of his ideals, making him a symbolic father figure to Lucius \u2014 even though Lucius is initially unaware of their connection. In a twist, it is revealed Acacius is married to Lucilla, Lucius\u2019 estranged mother, effectively making him Lucius\u2019 stepfather. Acacius is also disillusioned with Rome\u2019s corrupt leadership and seeks to reform it from within, putting him on a collision course with both the emperors and Macrinus.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283671\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Denzel Washington as Macrinus. (Image: Courtesy of Aidan Monaghan\/Aidan Monaghan - \u00a9 2024 Paramount Pictures\/IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nThe climactic arena battle: Lucius vs Acacius\r\nThe emperors find the prospect of Acacious fighting to death in the arena amusing and willingly prepare the duel. In the arena, Acacius looks beyond the hatred in Lucius' face and tries to reach him by telling him of his respect for Maximus and that he too hopes for a better Rome. He pleads that Lucius take the path of justice, not vengeance. In the arena, Acacius looks beyond the hatred in Lucius' face and tries to reach him by telling him of his respect for Maximus and that he too hopes for a better Rome. He urges Lucius to take the path of justice, not vengeance.\r\n\r\nWith such a choice between revenge and the lessons his father taught him, Lucius begins to falter. His conflict is heightened by the emperors' decision to have their guards kill Acacius on the spot, given that Lucius looked reluctant. The vengeance is taken away from Lucius, and he ends up with a bitter understanding of how Rome treats honour and justice: both he and Acacius were mere pawns in the larger game.\r\nMacrinus\u2019 hidden agenda comes to light\r\nAs Lucius processes Acacius, Macrinus takes advantage of the situation and betrays Lucilla, coercing Caracalla into murdering his rival co-emperor Geta. Geta's assassination renders Caracalla, known for his unpredictable violence, reliant on Macrinus, who becomes his confidant. Macrinus's motivation for the whole thing is very personal: he was once a slave under Marcus Aurelius and had been secretly vengeful, one day planning to overthrow him and remake Rome according to his own image.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283674\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] (Image: Courtesy of Aidan Monaghan\/Aidan Monaghan - \u00a9 2024 Paramount\u00a0Pictures\/IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nFinal battle: Lucius vs Macrinus\r\nLucius, now clear-eyed about the forces that shaped his suffering, confronts Macrinus in a brutal one-on-one battle. This is less a test of strength than a battle of good and evil between Lucius, representing a new Rome, and Macrinus, representing the corrupting-destructive world of revenge that Lucius now abhors. In the end, Lucius is triumphant, mortally wounding Macrinus and allowing the river to carry him off into the oblivion that the ending of such an era would seek to symbolise.\r\nLucius\u2019 call for a just Rome and a quiet finale\r\nHaving killed the emperors, Lucius, now speaking to the soldiers and gladiators of Rome, delivers a passionate speech about unity and justice. He declares Rome should regain the ideals his father fought for, that soldiers rebuild on a foundation of equality and freedom. His words urge new hope among the people and promise his rise as a reluctant yet principled leader.\r\n\r\nIn the final scene, Lucius stands alone in the vast, empty Colosseum, recalling his father's legacy and contemplating his own place within Rome. He is scarred by the personal losses that he incurred along the way, and realises that justice is often attained at great cost and one that must, however reluctantly, be paid.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4rgYUipGJNo\r\nGladiator 2\u00a0review\r\nGladiator 2, boasting a starry cast,\u00a0brings in more action and political intrigue, but it is not without some flaws. Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal are excellent, and yet, predictably, it is the great Denzel Washington who steals every scene he is in is as the power-hungry Macrinus. The epic battles between the gladiators throughout the film are thrilling; however, the movie sometimes gets bogged down in overly complicated political machinations.\r\n\r\nI found the sibling emperors a bit too cartoonish too and they definitely did not even come anywhere near the menace that Joaquin Phoenix brought to Commodus in the original. Maybe some more work could have been done there by the writers. Even for me, an old fan of Ridley Scott's work, this movie was too slow at times. All that aside, this movie is worth watching if you liked the first movie. Gladiator II\u00a0has all the visual spectacle and action you would expect and performances are uniformly excellent thanks to a great cast \u2014 even if it does not manage to capture the magic that made Gladiator such a classic.\r\nWill there be a Gladiator 3 and who might return from the Gladiator 2\u00a0cast?\r\nThe ending also leaves the possibility open for another chapter in the Gladiator franchise. Lucius' significant role, now having real power over people's lives, can mean that he will face both new political and personal challenges in attempting to uphold his father's legacy in an ever-dangerous and ever-morally complex Rome. If a third film follows it may explore the question of whether Lucius can actually succeed in transforming Rome or whether even he falls prey to this empty temptation of power. Who all among the Gladiator II\u00a0cast members will return in the potential sequel? Well, the dead ones won't, except in flashbacks.\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy of Aidan Monaghan\/Aidan Monaghan - \u00a9 2024 Paramount Pictures\/IMDb)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"10 best young adult movies to watch if you\u2019re a fan of \u2018My Fault\u2019","position":17,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/movies\/best-young-adult-movies-to-watch-anyone-but-you-after-ruby-red-make-me-believe\/","description":"The 2023 Spanish-language romance drama, My Fault or Culpa Mia, is a guilty pleasure for many.

Additionally, Mr. Plankton was released on Netflix as a limited series, which further lessens the possibility of a season 2.\r\n\r\nWatch all episodes of\u00a0Mr. Plankton\u00a0on\u00a0Netflix\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy netflixkr\/Instagram)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Mike Tyson\u2019s net worth: Decoding the wealth of the boxing legend","position":19,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/sports\/mike-tyson-net-worth-career-earnings-properties-car-collection\/","description":"Whether you identify as a sports fan or not, you must live under a rock (and for decades at that) to not know who Mike Tyson is. Such has been the impact of the yesteryear professional boxer on the sport. For the past three decades, he has regularly been in the headlines, be it for his actions in the ring or his 'vibrant' lifestyle away from it.\r\n\r\nArguably among the greatest boxers of all time, Tyson holds multiple records to his name and was the undisputed king of the sport from 1987 and 1990. With 50 wins from 58 matches, he drew the curtains on his career after losing to Irishman Kevin McBride in June 2005.\r\n\r\nHowever, 2024 had a surprise in store for us as Tyson announced that he would return to the ring to face YouTuber Jake Paul. Yes, there have been a few hiccups since then \u2014 the legendary boxer suffered an ulcer flare-up aboard a flight from Miami to Los Angeles in May 2024, forcing the bout on 20 July to be cancelled. But he has now recovered completely and eventually, took on Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Mike Tyson (@miketyson)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though he lost the fight and has been away from action for nearly 20 years, Tyson has indelibly left his mark with an unmatchable legacy. Besides, regular appearances in movies such as Rocky Balboa, The Hangover\u00a0series and Ip Man 3 and\u00a0music videos like Godzilla by Eminen meant that, over time, Tyson became a pop culture icon.\r\n\r\nSuch widespread success is often accompanied by fame and wealth. So exactly how rich is 'Iron Mike'? Scroll on to learn everything we know about the net worth of Mike Tyson in 2024 including his career earnings, lavish properties, fancy car collection, brand deals and more.\r\nMike Tyson: All we know about the wealth of the legendary American boxer\r\nHow much is the net worth of Mike Tyson?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283431\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Once among the wealthiest celebrities in the world, Mike Tyson, at present, has a relatively humble net worth. (Picture Credits: Mike Tyson\/Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFor someone as successful and popular as Tyson, his wealth is underwhelming, to say the least.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report by\u00a0Celebrity Net Worth, Mike Tyson, as of 2024, commands a net worth of USD 10 million (around HKD 77.8 million). Albeit not a meagre sum by any means, it does not meet the expectations of most people.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Tyson has a rugged history when it comes to his life outside the ring, including several lawsuits and a three-year stint in prison. He even filed for bankruptcy in 2003 with a debt of over USD 23 million. If this wasn't enough, the boxer is famous (or should we say infamous?) for being a spendthrift.\r\n\r\nAll the aforementioned factors explain why Mike Tyson's net worth is not as grand as other successful and iconic sports personalities.\r\nA look at Mike Tyson's career earnings\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283433\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Being one of the greatest boxers ever, Mike Tyson has earned a lot throughout his career. (Picture Credits: Mike Tyson\/Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSince he has not been a part of the professional boxing landscape for nearly two decades, Mike Tyson does not have a salary per fight. But in his prime, he has earned more than what most boxers today can even imagine.\r\n\r\nTyson's first major paycheck came in 1987 when he signed a contract with pay television network HBO worth USD 27 million that lasted for eight fights. Once that ran out, he inked a long-term USD 120 million deal with television network Showtime.\r\n\r\nHowever, all that glitters is not gold. While he was earning millions, Tyson had to shell out a major chunk of his income to his representative and one of the most popular wrestling promoters ever, Don King.\r\n\r\nTyson's biggest career paycheck came in 2002 for his fight with Lennox Lewis. Even\u00a0though the former lost the bout, he took home a staggering USD 103 million (which, in today's time, is equivalent to USD 148 million).\r\n\r\nCelebrity Net Worth suggests that, throughout his career, Mike Tyson has earned around USD 423 million. If we adjust that for inflation, in 2024 that amounts to well over USD 700 million.\r\nDeep diving into Mike Tyson's houses\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283435\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Over the years, Mike Tyson has owned some of the most stunning real-estate properties in history. (Picture Credits: Mike Tyson\/Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDon't let his net worth fool you \u2014 when we say Mike Tyson is known for his 'vibrant' lifestyle, we mean it in the truest sense of the term. A child with a modest upbringing in a Brooklyn-based apartment, at his peak Tyson owned several lavish mansions. In 2024, all his properties, put together, are worth well over USD 60 million.\r\n\r\nHere is a look at a few of them:\r\nOhio mansion\r\nThis grand property in Southington, Ohio had every luxurious amenity conceivable and then some. It boasted five bedrooms, a swimming pool, a jacuzzi and a basketball court. The entire house featured gold-plated furniture and was decked with crystal chandeliers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the property had massive steel cages to house \u2014 wait for it \u2014 four tigers! That's right. The boxer was popular for his collection of Bengal tigers and spent around USD 70,000 for each of them. Moreover, he hired a trainer to take care of the big cats and paid him USD 125,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nAs fate would have it, Tyson's three-year prison sentence from 1992 (which was initially meant to be for six years) resulted in the boxer becoming financially unstable. Therefore, he was forced to sell this amazing property in 1999 for around USD 1.1 million.\r\n\r\nLater on, it was converted to a church. However, the basketball court remains intact and has Tyson's name etched on the front gate.\r\nConnecticut property\r\nBesides the mansion in Ohio, Mike Tyson also owned a huge property in Farmington, Connecticut that screams opulence from every corner. Spread over 50,000 square feet, this house featured as many as 52 rooms, 21 of which were bedrooms and 25 bathrooms.\r\n\r\nOther features of the house included an indoor pool, a hot tub, an indoor basketball court, multiple game rooms, a casino, a recording studio and a green-screen room. Moreover, there was a private nightclub in the mansion.\r\n\r\nWhen Tyson was declared bankrupt in 2003, he had to sell this property to renowned American rapper 50 Cent for USD 4.3 million (approx.). Eventually, 50 Cent sold the house as well in 2019 due to its mammoth maintenance cost.\r\nMaryland property\r\nIn 1995, Mike Tyson's former wife Monica Turner bought this property, with the couple living here in the early 2000s before getting divorced. The boxer got the house in their divorce settlement.\r\n\r\nA 30-minute drive from Washington, D.C. takes you to this beautiful mansion that overlooks the Congressional Country Club golf course. For the unversed, this course has hosted several editions of the prestigious US Open golf tournament.\r\n\r\nThe house sports seven bedrooms, a gymnasium, a swimming pool, a spa, a game room, a sports centre and a piano room with a Weber grand piano.\r\n\r\nAccording to reports, Tyson listed the house for sale at an estimated USD 9 million.\r\nNevada property\r\nOnce he moved out of his Maryland mansion, Mike Tyson shifted to a new home in the suburbs of Henderson in Las Vegas, Nevada. The house, located in the gated community of Seven Hills, boasted six bedrooms, six bathrooms and a private balcony. This two-storeyed property was spread across 5,740 square feet and even featured a 25-foot-high waterfall in the reception room!\r\n\r\nMany of us remember this house from the 2009 film\u00a0The Hangover where the four central characters (one of them played by Bradley Cooper) stole a tiger after creeping into the property. Tyson gave director Todd Phillips unrestricted access to shoot the scenes.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/XhkJ9H7KD6M?si=Yx_R-fy0MSYOgP4L\r\n\r\nEventually, he sold the house in 2016 for nearly USD 2 million.\r\n\r\nToday, Mike Tyson has renounced his eccentric lifestyle. At present, he lives in a different property in the Seven Hills community, close to the famed Las Vegas strip. This Mediterranean-style villa is spread over 10,400 square feet and has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It is the only property currently owned by him and is worth USD 2.5 million.\r\nA peek into Mike Tyson's car collection\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283437\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Many believe that Mike Tyson has owned over 100 cars to date. (Picture Credits: Mike Tyson\/Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThroughout his career, Mike Tyson has recklessly bought cars and bikes. Many reports suggest that he has owned over a hundred vehicles in his lifetime. We cannot confirm if this figure is correct, but the boxer has certainly driven some exquisite cars over the years.\r\n\r\nHere are the best ones worth mentioning:\r\nCadillac Seville\r\nThe Cadillac Seville, bought by Mike Tyson in 1985, was his second Cadillac after the Eldorado that was gifted to him by his co-manager Jim Jacobs.\r\n\r\n \tEngine: 4.1-litre V8 engine\r\n \tOutput:\u00a0135 horsepower\r\n \tTransmission:\u00a0Four-speed automatic\r\n \t0 to 100 kilometres per hour:\u00a0Around 13 seconds\r\n\r\nMuch ahead of its time, the Seville offered electronic control for the stereo system, climate control, suspension and a fuel-injection system. While it wasn't the fastest vehicle back in the day, this Cadillac model was luxurious to the core.\r\nRolls-Royce Corniche\r\nTo celebrate his International Boxing Federation (IBF) World Championship win in 1987, Mike Tyson bought the Rolls-Royce Corniche. This car was based on a prototype vehicle that was blown up in a French dock in the early days of World War II.\r\n\r\n \tEngine: 6.75-litre V8 engine\r\n \tOutput:\u00a0205 horsepower\r\n \tTransmission:\u00a0Three-speed automatic\r\n \t0 to 100 kilometres per hour:\u00a0Around 10 seconds\r\n\r\nEven though it sported a massive engine, the car was slow due to its immense weight. But the comfort it provided was hard to beat. As a result, the Corniche became a favourite among celebrities like Tyson, Michael Caine, Paul McCartney and Elton John (to name a few).\r\nBentley Continental SC\r\nThe Bentley Continental Sedanca Coupe (SC) was a retro-looking variant of the Continental T. However, it was futuristic in every other sense.\r\n\r\n \tEngine: 6.75-litre turbocharged V8 engine\r\n \tOutput:\u00a0420 horsepower\r\n \tTransmission:\u00a0Four-speed automatic\r\n \t0 to 100 kilometres per hour:\u00a0Around six seconds\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Mike Tyson got his hands on this rare Continental variant. For context, Bentley made only 78 of these bad boys. The model in his garage featured two detachable glass sunroof panels over the front seat.\r\nFerrari F50\r\nAfter spending three years in prison, Mike Tyson returned to the ring in 1996 and defeated Frank Bruno to claim the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight title. As a reward, he gifted himself the stunning Ferrari F50.\r\n\r\n \tEngine: 4.7-litre V12 engine\r\n \tOutput:\u00a0512 horsepower\r\n \tTransmission:\u00a0Six-speed automatic\r\n \t0 to 100 kilometres per hour:\u00a0Around four seconds\r\n\r\nThis lightning-fast car was a revolutionary creation by Ferrari. It was the brand's first road car to feature a tub made entirely of carbon fibre.\r\nLamborghini Super Diablo Twin Turbo\r\nPerhaps the most picturesque sports car Mike Tyson ever owned, the Lamborghini Super Diablo Twin Turbo was an upgraded variant of the Diablo VT.\r\n\r\n \tEngine: 5.7-litre twin-turbo V12 engine\r\n \tOutput:\u00a0850 horsepower\r\n \tTransmission:\u00a0Five-speed automatic\r\n \t0 to 100 kilometres per hour:\u00a0Around three seconds\r\n\r\nBack in the day, Tyson spent over USD 500,000 to make the Super Diablo one of the fastest road cars money could buy. The yellow-and-black paint job of the vehicle resembled the Bengal tigers he owned.\r\nWhich brands does Mike Tyson endorse?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Mike Tyson (@miketyson)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven his fame, it isn't surprising to see Mike Tyson enjoy endorsement deals with several multinational brands such as CopperGel, Smart Cups and Black Energy Drink, among others. He also has a ranch named Tyson Ranch where the manufacturing and distribution of his merchandise takes place.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1986 that Tyson started attracting the attention of brands for sponsorship after he became the youngest heavyweight champion in history. Companies such as Pepsi and Nintendo were the first to approach. Others like Eastman Kodak and EA Sports eventually hopped on the bandwagon.\r\n\r\nHowever, brands started to maintain their distance from him once allegations of domestic violence against the boxer came to light. It took Tyson a long time to clear his public image and regain companies on his endorsement portfolio.\r\nMike Tyson's philanthropic deeds\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283439\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Despite getting involved in controversies from time to time, Mike Tyson is revered for his philanthropic deeds. (Picture Credits: Mike Tyson\/Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nGrowing up in New York, Tyson struggled with poverty during his childhood and, if his philanthropic deeds are anything to go by, it looks like his lived experiences made him a benevolent soul. From time to time, he does his bit to help those in need.\r\n\r\nIn October 2012, the boxer founded the Mike Tyson Cares Foundation. The objective of this non-profit organisation is to provide shelter to children from broken homes and give them a fighting chance by catering to their all-round needs.\r\n\r\nBesides his foundation, Tyson regularly participates in charity events to raise funds for social causes.\r\n\r\n(Hero and Featured Images Credits: Mike Tyson\/Instagram)\r\n\r\nThis story first appeared here."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Is \u2018The Penguin\u2019 getting a season 2? Here\u2019s everything we know so far","position":20,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/streaming\/will-there-be-a-season-2-of-the-penguin-colin-farrell\/","description":"The HBO series The Penguin\u00a0has quickly captivated fans of the DC Universe with Colin Farrell\u2019s gripping portrayal of Oswald Cobb, aka The Penguin, a ruthless underworld figure in Gotham City. As season one concludes on such a high note, fans are already asking: will there be a season 2 of The Penguin? Here\u2019s a detailed look at everything we know about The Penguin season 2, its potential release date, cast expectations, and the future of Gotham\u2019s most ambitious villain.\r\n\r\nSpoilers for The Penguin season 1 ahead\r\nWhat is The Penguin series all about?\r\nThe Penguin series builds on Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman (2022), where Colin Farrell\u2019s chilling (and total) transformation into the Penguin earned widespread acclaim. In the series, we probe deeper into the character\u2019s life as he manoeuvres his way up the crime ladder in Gotham City, carving his own empire amidst rival factions (he basically destroys the Falcone and Maroni crime families). Through intense storytelling, Farrell\u2019s and Cristin Milioti\u2019s powerful performances and that shocking, heart-rending ending, The Penguin has given fans an unforgettable look into the Gotham crime scene and now we want a season 2.\r\nWill there be a The Penguin season 2?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283085\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] The Penguin season 2 is yet to be confirmed. (Image: Courtesy of IMDb)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nUp until now, HBO has not ordered a season 2 for The Penguin, and we actually know that it was planned out as a miniseries. But given the enormous success the show elicited among its audience and from critics, many believe Warner Bros just might go ahead and extend it beyond just a single season. That is still a little uncertain, though. However, there is cause for hope.\r\n\r\nWe do know that Farrell himself has expressed willingness to reprise the role in a potential season 2. While speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a great idea [for season two], and the writing was really muscular and as strong or stronger on the page than it was the first season, of course I would do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe showrunner Lauren LeFranc has also conveyed similar thoughts. In an interview with The Direct, she said, \"I mean, we put it all out on the table. I think that in order to do a second season, we have to feel like we can top ourselves. We have to feel like there's something more there to really dig into. I mean, I really care about all these characters, even if they're terrible people.\"\r\n\r\nMatt Reeves himself was asked about it. He told The Hollywood Reporter: \u201cEverything is on the table. But at the end of the day, we feel like there are more stories to tell in this world. So me and Lauren and [producer Dylan Clark] and Colin are talking and we\u2019re trying to figure out whatever it is, it has to dig into this in a way that feels earned the way this was.\" It is not wholly promising, but it is what it is.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that the Bat-verse was created by Reeves\u2019 The Batman (2022) and is in no way related to the DC Universe (DCU) that James Gunn is building. Rather, it is its own self-contained universe of Batman movies and shows.\r\n\r\nGunn has said that every DC movie or show that will not be in the DCU shared universe will be in the Elseworlds brand, which in comics explores alternate-universe versions of popular DC heroes and villains. The Joker movies, including the sequel, Joker Folie \u00e0 Deux, are also in Elseworlds.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283087\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Besides Farrell, Cristin Milioti also received a lot of praise for her performance as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin. (Image: Courtesy of IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nPotential The Penguin season 2 release date\r\nEven if HBO immediately greenlights The Penguin Season 2, fans should be prepared for a possible wait. So what is the The Penguin season 2 release date that we should expect? Such productions take a lot in pre-production since scripts for their episodes are complex and stories and characters take a while for writers to put into place. It\u2019s likely that a potential release date would be sometime in 2026 after the release of The Batman: Part II or even later. The ending of the show teased a possible spinoff featuring Milioti\u2019s Sofia Falcone and Selina Kyle or Catwoman (Zo\u00eb Kravitz) as the former received a letter from the latter who claimed they are cousins.\r\n\r\nThe first season\u2019s production required significant time due to the extensive makeup, costuming, and visual effects that make Gotham City (and its underbelly) feel authentic, so another season would likely follow a similar timeline.\r\nWhat could happen in The Penguin season 2?\r\nIf The Penguin continues, season 2 could probe even deeper into Oz Cobblepot\u2019s rise to power. Actually, season 2\u2019s plot will depend on what happens in The Batman: Part II. We might see Oswald face new challenges, both from new rival crime lords and law enforcement in Gotham, as he seeks to solidify his control over the city.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, The Penguin season 2 could introduce more iconic characters from Batman\u2019s rogues gallery that will add to the complexity of Gotham\u2019s criminal landscape.\r\nThe Penguin season 2 cast\r\nWho will be in the cast of The Penguin season 2? A second season of The Penguin would most likely see Colin Farrell reprising his role as the titular character. Farrell\u2019s transformation into Cobblepot is a huge part of the show\u2019s appeal, so his return is essential. Other potential returning cast members include Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone. As far as the return of Victor \"Vic\" Aguilar is concerned, unfortunately, that won't be possible because we saw him being choked to death by Oz. Though he might potentially return in flashbacks, we are not counting on it.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, The Penguin was planned as a limited series, the demand for further storytelling of Batman's villain might just change the mind of execs at HBO and Warner Bros for season 2. As anticipation rises with each passing day, it may only be a matter of time before we hear the news, positive or negative. We do wish it is greenlit as it will allow the writers to probe deeper into the underbelly of Gotham and Oz Cobb's character. All that we can do at the moment is hope the execs see the merit in the expansion of\u00a0Penguin's\u00a0tale.\r\n\r\nWatch The Penguin in Hong Kong on HBO here.\r\n\r\n(Hero and Featured Image: Courtesy of IMDb)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Over 60 million people tuned in to watch Jake Paul\u00a0Vs.

They allegedly started dating in 1999 and made their debut as a couple at the Teen Choice Awards that same year. The two never confirmed their relationship but likely split up in 2001 as Hathaway's career took off with The Princess Diaries, which came out the same year.\r\n\r\nThe two actors remained amicable post-breakup and reunited in 2010 on the set of Valentine's Day, starring opposite each other. During the movie's press tour back in the day, the duo was asked how they portrayed their characters' on-screen relationship with such authenticity, to which Grace famously answered to ScreenSlam, \"We had a lot of comfort with each other,\" alluding to their dating history.\u00a0\r\nScott Sartiano (2002)\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5283067\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1080\"] Picture Credits: Instagram\/Scott Sartiano[\/caption]\r\n\r\nProfession: Restaurateur \r\nHow did they meet: Not known\u00a0\r\n\r\nFollowing the widespread success of The Princess Diaries, Hathaway got into romantic entanglements with prominent men, one of them being famous New York City-based restauranteur Scott Sartiano.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe duo was first spotted in public in 2002 and then on several occasions throughout the year.

This was perhaps her most written-about relationship before her marriage to Adam Shulman.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThey started dating in early 2004 after being introduced by a mutual friend. Despite Follieri being late for their first date, he managed to charm Hathaway with a bouquet of roses and his Italian accent. The couple was frequently seen together over the next few years, seemingly deep in love and living \u2018the good life.\u2019 However, their relationship took a turn when Follieri was arrested in 2008 due to his involvement in the Vati-Con scandal.

Though the actors did not portray the typical romantic couple on-screen, reports about them developing an off-screen connection surfaced online.\r\n\r\nIn August 2008, Just Jared reported that the duo was spotted having dinner together. An eyewitness shared with Life & Style Magazine that the two seemed to be an item. \"They were really into each other, giggling and smiling and even holding hands at one point. You could almost taste their chemistry,\" they said.\r\n\r\nHowever, after that one date, there were no further public sightings of their PDA. The alleged Hollywood couple seemingly went their separate ways shortly thereafter as Lucas started dating Mean Girls actor Rachel McAdams at the beginning of 2009 and Hathaway got into a relationship with her now-husband Adam Shulman.\r\nAdam Shulman (2008 to present)\r\n\r\nAnne Hathaway and Adam Shulman at En Japanese Brasserie in New York City. pic.twitter.com\/jxWcrcr9an\r\n\u2014 21 (@21metgala) May 5, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nProfession: Actor, producer and jewellery designer\r\nHow did they meet: At a film festival\r\n\r\nRight after her widely-covered and consumed separation from Follieri and the one-time dinner with Lucas, Anne Hathaway met actor and producer Adam Shulman, at the 2008 Palm Springs Film Festival.\r\n\r\nThis meeting was the start of a whirlwind romance which was kept under wraps for the initial two years. However, after 3 years together, Shulman designed an engagement ring for Hathaway and popped the big question. In September 2012, this new \u2018it\u2019 couple of Hollywood married in Big Sur, California with an intimate woodland ceremony, with vows exchanged amid the scenic redwoods.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn a 2013 interview with Harper's Bazaar, The Intern actor expressed that \"I knew from the second I met him that he was the love of my life.

Two years later, he turned professional and defeated YouTuber AnEsonGib in January 2020 by first-round TKO.\r\n\r\nThe following two years were pivotal for Paul. By 2022, he had defeated mixed martial artist Anderson Silva (earning around USD 1.5 million), Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley (earning around USD 2 million) and former basketball player Nate Robinson (earning USD 1.2 million) in crucial rounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sportskeeda, Jake Paul earned around USD 40 million in purses and PPV from his 2021 boxing career alone, catapulting his net worth to higher levels.\r\n\r\nHowever, his first professional defeat was against Tommy Fury via split decision.

Here we bring you all the details of the Netflix original series\u00a0Mr. Plankton, from the plot to the ending, explained.\r\n\r\nSpoilers ahead!\r\n\r\nAnother romance K-drama from the writer of It\u2019s Okay to Not Be Okay, Mr. Plankton is a tender but heartwrenching tale of optimism and a love that is impossible to achieve. When protagonist Hae-jo is obliged to deal with a terminal illness with only three months to live, he learns that grief is always difficult, surprising and nonlinear. As he embarks on his final journey of life accompanied by his ex-girlfriend Jae-mi, hopes, regrets, and moments of short-lived joy make his last days memorable.\r\n\r\nA Hong Jong-chan directorial, Mr. Plankton stars Woo Do-hwan and Lee You-mi in leading roles. While Woo is known for one of the most-watched K-dramas on Netflix, Bloodhounds (2023), Lee is popular for shows like All of Us Are Dead season 1 (2022) and Squid Game season 1 (2021).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the duo's latest release, Mr. Plankton, has been applauded by critics and fans for good reasons. The show will make you swoon more often than not, as a naive Jae-mi, initially unaware of her ex-lover Hae-jo\u2019s sickness, tries to stay away from him but fails miserably. However, the ending of Mr. Plankton, which poignantly explores the show\u2019s recurring question, \u201cWhy do tragedies keep happening to people whose lives are already pathetic?\u201d, is more likely to have you reaching for a tissue box.\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: The cast and their characters\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282773\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] From the left, Woo Do-hwan, Lee You-mi, Hong Jong-chan, Kim Hae-sook and Oh Jung-se at a Netflix press conference for the show.

However, at the tender age of eight, his parents discovered that the clinic had made a mistake with the sperm, and Seung-hyeok was not his father\u2019s biological child.\r\n\r\nIn the last episode, a flashback gives an even clearer picture of Seung-hyeok\u2019s past. After his parents discover the truth about his birth, their relationship deteriorates. One night Seung-hyeok\u2019s mother asks if he wants to go stargazing with her, to which he says no. The next morning, police officials inform his father that she is no more and her car fell off a mountain, hinting at the fact that it could have been suicide. Seung-hyeok\u2019s father withdraws completely from that day and ends up ignoring all of his son\u2019s pleas. On his graduation day, Hae-jo asks his father to come to get him jjajangmyeon but when the latter doesn\u2019t come, Seung-hyeok abandons that life and runs away. He is then found by Bong-suk, who raises him and gives him a new identity, Hae-jo.\r\n\r\nIn the present, Hae-jo and Jae-mi are on their way to Gangwon to meet the fourth individual who could probably turn out to be his biological father. For context, Hae-jo inherited a rare brain disease from his biological father and only has three months left to live. So he embarks on a final journey to reunite with his biological father. Accompanying him is his ex-girlfriend Jae-mi. In the last episode, Hae-jo, freshly out of the hospital after his latest treatment session, informs a worried Jae-mi in the middle of the night that it would be too late if he did not meet his father soon and leaves in a cab. At first, it seemed like Hae-jo went to approach the fourth potential sperm donor but it was Choi Yeong-jo.\r\n\r\nThe duo spot each other outside the latter's house and Hae-jo, after staying away from Yeong-jo since his teenage days, finally breaks down while embracing his father. Yeong-jo hugs him back and takes him inside the house he was once raised in. When Hae-jo enters his childhood room, he realises that Yeong-jo never threw away his belongings and his room still looks the same way it did when he had left. Hae-jo lays down on his bed and finally feels at home.\r\n\r\nLater that night, Hae-jo embarks on another road trip but before leaving he pens down a message for Yeong-jo on his business card that reads, \u201cI'm your son, Choi Seung-hyeok\u201d\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: Do Hae-jo and Jae-mi reunite?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Netflix Korea | \ub137\ud50c\ub9ad\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544 (@netflixkr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last episode of the romantic K-drama opens with Jae-mi wandering on the streets of Gangwon crying her eyes out. For context, in the penultimate episode, Jae-mi learns that Hae-jo tricked her into believing that they were going to meet his biological father in Gangwon. Earlier in the series, he had promised Jae-mi, who has been an orphan all her life, that he would find her birth mother one day. In the last episode, he fulfills that promise. Hae-jo drops her in front of her real mother's doorstep and leaves, thinking it would hurt Jae-mi less if she didn't witness his final moments. However, Jae-mi is less concerned about her mother refusing to recognize her and more about reuniting with Hae-jo.\r\n\r\nShe calls Ki-ho for help but the latter advises her to return to Seoul. Meanwhile, Hae-jo meets Eo Heung, Jae-mi\u2019s ex-fiance, and the duo share a meal. He recalls his past actions and voices how he should have never abandoned his loved ones, be it Choi Yeong-jo or Jae-mi.\r\n\r\nHae-jo then reaches Seoul and reunites with Bong-suk and Jae-mi. He also promises Jae-mi that he won't abandon her until his last day in the world. Later, Jae-mi picks him up from Yeong-jo\u2019s place and the lovers wander around Korea in Hae-jo's jeep, going from one destination to the next.\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: What happens to Eo Heung?\r\nEo Heung, Jae-mi's ex-fiance, makes peace with the fact that Jae-mi chose to stay with Hae-jo. Additionally, he meets his mother Beom Ho-ja one last time, before driving off to an unknown destination. Later, she calls him and encourages him to wander off and have fun. But he should come back once he starts missing her food.\r\n\r\nA few months later, Hae-jo and Jae-mi\u00a0get a notification of a live video from 'Heung the Drifter'. It shows Eo Heung, who now is a content creator, sharing his experiences of hiking through Geumjoengsan, a mountain in Busan.\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: Does Hae-jo survive?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282775\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Woo Do-hwan as Hae-jo in the show. (Image: Courtesy netflixkr\/Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNo, he doesn't. Mr. Plankton ends in a bitter-sweet note, with Hae-jo spending his final moments in the arms of his one true love, Jae-mi.\r\n\r\nIn the last episode, Hae-jo and Jae-mi have the best time of their lives exploring Korea on wheels. Soon it's winter, and the couple go on yet another road trip. On their way, they spot a beautiful location in the snow and run out to play. Hae-jo dares Jae-mi to find a rare four-leaf clover and promises to stay at a hotel with her and not opt for a camp if she succeeds. She agrees and wanders off to find one.\r\n\r\nIn the next few moments, Hae-jo\u2019s nose starts bleeding. He realises that his time has come and gets flashes of his life. \u201cI want to die under the dazzling blue sky\u201d, he recalls. He then lays down on the snow, looks up to the sky with tears and hears Jae-mi running towards him while crying her eyes out. When she reaches him and holds him in her arms, he laments how desperately he wants to live and be with her forever. He caresses her face and smiles as his voiceover shares his final thoughts, \u201cYou are the last scene of my life. Well, I guess then I had\u2026a pretty good life. It was so much fun. Thorough and complete. I love you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore the credits roll, Jae-mi too confesses her love for Hae-jo, who then tears up and smiles at her for one last time. The scene then shifts to their jeep driving off into the distance.\r\n\r\nWatch all episodes of Mr. Plankton on Netflix\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy netflixkr\/Instagram)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Meet the South Korean gaming sensation Faker: His career highlights, net worth and more","position":28,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/faker-net-worth-career-highlights-brand-endorsements\/","description":"In the growing world of competitive gaming, some call him \u2018God\u2019 while others hail him as \u2018The Michael Jordan of Video Games\u2019. Some others have given him a much more grandiose title: \u2018The Unkillable Demon King\u2019. Internationally recognised by his gaming alias Faker, Lee Sang-hyeok is a multi-millionaire by net worth \u2014\u00a0a status he has earned by becoming the legend of the online game League of Legends (LoL).\r\n\r\nLee Sang-hyeok, aka Faker, has been a professional gamer for over a decade. He took the decision as a teenager and is today widely known as the greatest player of LoL ever. His fame (and fortune) have risen steadily since he turned pro.\r\n\r\nIn his long and distinguished career, Faker has won the League of Legends World Championship five times \u2014 the first and only one to do so. In fact, it is just an extension of his earlier record of being the first to win it four times. He has won the League of Legends\u00a0Champions Korea (LCK), the premier domestic LoL tournament in South Korea, a record 10 times and two Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) titles.\r\n\r\nA player of T1 (formerly SK Telecom T1), Faker is the first inductee into the Hall of Legends, the \u2018hall of fame\u2019 equivalent created by LoL\u2019s developer Riot Games in May 2024. Previously, he was included in Forbes\u2019 \u201830 Under 30 - Asia - Entertainment & Sports\u2019 list of 2019.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the impact of Faker on LoL and eSports that his rise and accomplishments are often compared to Ronaldo \u2014 the retired Brazilian legend, not Cristiano Ronaldo. In fact, a sports documentary titled Ronaldo X Faker: The Phenom\u00a0was produced in 2017 by a Korean TV channel drawing parallels between the lives of the two stars from completely different sporting worlds.\r\n\r\nFaker\u2019s popularity can be gauged from the fact that the 2024 World Championship held at O2 Arena in London on 2 November between Faker\u2019s team and Bilibili Gaming was watched by 6.9 million viewers at its peak, making it the most-viewed eSports match in history. Sports Illustrated\u00a0noted that \u201cFaker's involvement\u201d in the final was the \u201cmost vital\u201d contributor to the viewership.\r\nWhat is League of Legends?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282657\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1500\"] Faker (2nd, L) and the other members of the T1 team with the 2024 World Championship. (Image credit: LoL Esports\/@lolesports via X)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBefore we get into the Faker\u2019s net worth and facts, a quick look at the game which made him one of the world\u2019s greatest eSports player as well as a multimillionaire.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Riot Games, League of Legends\u00a0is a team-based strategy game in which two teams of up to five players go head-to-head with an objective to destroy the other's base.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 140 champion characters for the players to chose from the massive database of the immensely popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game.\r\n\r\nLoL was originally launched in 2009. According to reports, the game has around 150-160 million active monthly players. It is free-to-play but character customisations and other in-game items are purchasable.\r\n\r\nLoL is one of the world\u2019s most popular games of all time. According to a 2020 report by the Olympic Games, the 2019 World Championship finals of the game in Europe were watched by 100 million unique viewers.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the 2019 National Football League (NFL) Super Bowl was watched by 98.2 million viewers. Its celebrity fans and players include Linkin Park, which composed the official album of the 2024 World Championship, and Democratic Party leader Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others.\r\n\r\nThe MOBA game was part of the demonstration event for eSports at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang in Indonesia. Demonstration event means that medals, though awarded, are not officially counted in the tally. LoL\u00a0was once again part of the eSports event which made its debut as a medal event at the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. It will now be part of the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi and Nagoya, Japan. Of course, fans hope that Faker, will be a part of the South Korean team.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is Faker? A look at the South Korean gaming legend\r\nWhat is the net worth of Faker?\r\nThere is no doubt that Lee Sang-hyeok aka Faker is a multi-millionaire by net worth. Multiple reports confirm the same. However, there is no conclusive information about exactly how much wealth Faker owns.\r\n\r\nThe only verifiable information available about the eSports legend concerns his salary, as published in the Olympic Games' report about his career. At the time, Faker was a three-time World Championship winner \u2013 one of only two players to do so. His prize money since he turned professional in 2013 was estimated at more than USD 1 million.\r\n\r\nUp till 2020, Faker was also earning an estimated USD 5 million per year from his prize money, endorsement deals, merchandising fees and other income. According to the profile on the Olympic Games, the figure was more than the average earnings of an English Premier League footballer.\r\n\r\nNow, according to a 2024 report by AFP, his annual earnings are close to KRW 10 billion (around USD 7.2 million). This indicates that the net worth of Faker is growing rapidly and he could earn even more in the next couple of years as the gaming world expands.\r\nFaker\u2019s major brand endorsements\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282663\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1440\"] Faker poses with members of K-pop group Enhypen as part of a promotional activity for Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

His accomplishments are truly incredible and his skill as as a player is near unparalleled. According to AFP, it is said in South Korea that not everyone may know what LoL is but everyone knows Faker. This is why he is a magnet for major brands. Of course, income from endorsements, even though unclear, do add to the net worth of Faker.\r\n\r\nAmong the most well-known commercials that Faker has starred in are a series of ads for SK Telecom. Those are notable because the gamer co-starred with South Korean football icon Son Heung-min, the captain of both the national team and Tottenham Hotspur.\r\n\r\n\"It was a big honour for me,\" Faker told ESPN.\u00a0\"Overall, I think it's a very good experience for me to be on those various advertisements.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther brands endorsed by Faker include Nike, Red Bull, Samsung and fashion brand Vandy the Pink.\r\n\r\nWhile most of his endorsements are as part of the T1 team, with a special focus on him, the one with American-Singaporean gaming hardware and electronics producer Razer is an individual sponsorship deal. As part of the deal, which was signed in 2021, the company has been releasing gaming hardware as exclusive Faker editions.

He captioned it as \"Mine\", but it is not clear if it was part of a promotion or his own car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Faker(\u1111\u1166\u110b\u1175\u110f\u1165) (@faker)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BMW deal ended in 2023, when T1 partnered with Mercedes-Benz. Reports suggest that Faker received a Mercedes-Benz EQE electric car as a part of the deal, but its exact ownership details remain unclear.\r\n\r\nHis social media following, too, add to the net worth of Faker. The gaming legend has around 1.8 million followers on Instagram, 1.9 million followers on YouTube and 3.9 million followers on Twitch. His videos on YouTube and Twitch also generate a revenue stream for the gaming great.\r\nImportant facts about Faker you should know\r\nHe has played for a single team to this date and is now its part owner\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282655\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1500\"] A young Faker at the 2015 World Championship.

He holds the record for the longest career playing for a single team in the world of professional gaming.\r\n\r\nThe team was known as SK Telecom T1 when Faker made his pro debut with it in 2013. It is operated by T1 Entertainment & Sports, which is a joint venture between South Korea\u2019s wireless telecom major SK Telecom and American sports and entertainment company Comcast Spectacor.\r\n\r\nWhile other players joined and left T1 over the years, Faker remained a constant. In fact, reports say that he did not accept offers worth millions of dollars from other teams asking him to join them. His unparalleled loyalty to T1 has earned Faker the respect of the gaming community.\r\n\r\nAccording to AFP, Joe Marsh, the CEO of T1, Chinese teams have often tried to recruit Faker.\r\n\r\n\"Every time he's a free agent the offer from China comes in and it's USD 20 million a year to come,\" Marsh had said previously.\r\n\r\nFaker's thoughts are different. He has said that he wants to play for South Korea.\r\n\r\n\u201c[T1] is a team that I\u2019m part of,\u201d Faker told Korea JoongAng Daily\u00a0in 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve been with T1 for a very long time. So I think a lot of people could put me and T1 together.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe same year he signed a new three-year deal with T1, which also made him part-owner of T1 Entertainment & Sports. This move is certainly set to increase the net worth of Faker by quite a few millions in the future.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, he signed another deal which confirmed his contract period as a gamer till 2025, at which point Faker\u2019s age will be nearing 30. Though gamers have a much younger retirement age than in other sports, Faker has not revealed when he would hang his mouse and keyboard.\r\nHe has won an Asian Games gold medal\r\nThis is one of Faker\u2019s most significant career achievements: He has an actual Asiad competitive gold medal to his name! He won it for South Korea at the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou. It was a historic achievement for LoL, Faker as well as South Korea as it was the first time that eSports was counted as a medal event.\r\n\r\nThe gold medal earned him an exemption from South Korea's mandatory military service, which even legendary K-pop boyband BTS could not avoid despite their historic accomplishments in the world of music.\r\n\r\nEven when eSports made its debut at the 2018 edition of the quadrennial tournament, Faker had won a medal, a silver, for South Korea in the LoL event.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough it was a demonstration event, being able to wear the Taegeukgi on my chest and represent Korea did feel different,\u201d Faker told Korea JoongAng Daily, referring to his pride of wearing the national flag of South Korea.\r\nHe set a Twitch livestream record on debut\r\nIn 2017, Faker took to livestreaming for the first time on the popular video-streaming platform Twitch. With a record 245,100 concurrent viewers, his debut stream became the most-viewed single stream ever on Twitch at the time. All he did in his debut stream was play casual games online and chat with his fans.\r\n\r\nWithin 11 months, he had amassed a Twitch following of over 1 million to become the 34th most-followed streamer on the platform by early 2018.\r\n\r\nThe same year, however, his record for most-viewed single stream was broken by American LoL\u00a0streamer Tyler Steinkamp, aka Tyler1.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis \u2018kill\u2019 records are unmatched\r\n\u2018Kill\u2019 in LoL\u00a0is essentially eliminating an opponent player. Faker is so deft at playing the game that he has repeatedly set and broken his own kill records in both domestic and international championships.\r\n\r\nThree of his most incredible records were set one after the other at the 2024 World Championship in London. On 12 October, he became the first player to score 100 wins in an LoL. A few days later during the tournament, he became the first player to get his 500th kill in a world championship. He ended the tournament with the Finals MVP award, making him the first player to win it twice.\r\n\r\n5\u20e30\u20e30\u20e3 KILLS AT WORLDS FOR @FAKER. pic.twitter.com\/aIbFdcvlnI\r\n\u2014 LoL Esports (@lolesports) November 2, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in 2022, he had become the first player to get 500 kills in the LCK. He has since far surpassed that record.\r\n\r\nThis incredible kill record is the reason why Faker is known as the \u2018Unkillable Demon King\u2019.\r\n\r\nHero and Featured images: LoL Esports\/@lolesports via X"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"How \u2018Sh\u014dgun\u2019 and TV\u2019s biggest hits banked on authentic story lines to succeed","position":29,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/why-shogun-banked-on-authenticity-success\/","description":"\r\nAuthenticity reigned supreme at the recent 76th Primetime Emmy Awards held in October 2024, with FX\u2019s Sh\u014dgun and The Bear both emerging as top winners in their categories. Key in the discussion of these shows\u2019 successes \u2014 is the notion that authentic story will always pay off. With viewers and critics alike lauding Sh\u014dgun for its dedication to authenticity, we take a deep dive into why television\u2019s biggest success read winners have become the golden standard for world-building and story crafting today.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an interesting, confusing conundrum about humanity\u2019s relationship with\u00a0cinema. We watch TV shows and movies to lose ourselves in the plot; we want to be engaged and removed from the real world, seeking the escapism provided to us by way of dramatic storylines, exquisite costuming, and sterling performances from our best-beloved actors.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, there is something inherently intriguing about art that imitates life. We want to identify with the characters we see on screen. Hand over hearts, we adopt our favourite characters with empathy and understanding, integrating them into our lives and adopting\u00a0their troubles as our own. In this manner, we identify and commiserate, finding fragments of our own lived experiences within their narrated storylines.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is when a perfect balance is struck between fictional and relatable that the true artistry of poetic cinema is revealed. Genuine storylines dripping with humanity are devoured whole by audiences hungry for more.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo wit: Sh\u014dgun, initially planned for a single season, has been renewed for a second and third season. But what do viewers of today share with Edo-period warlords? The truth, simply, is this: nothing, but also everything.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA success story in authentic craft with Sh\u014dgun, Heeramandi, and more\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Hiroyuki Sanada first stepped onstage at the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards this past September to accept the award for Outstanding Drama Series, he wasn\u2019t just making awards history with Sh\u014dgun \u2014 he was reclaiming his heritage on a global stage. Sanada, who both produced and starred in the feudal-era drama based on James Clavell\u2019s 1975 novel of the same name, was a fundamental driving force in keeping the series accountable to its origins.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an expansive budget of USD 250 million for 10 episodes, the series found incredible stewardship in Sanada\u2019s hands. A veteran in the Japanese filmmaking industry, Sanada is no stranger to Samurai-themed movies, having starred in films and television productions such as The Twilight Samurai (2002), The Last Samurai (2003), Westworld (2007) and more.\u00a0His distinctive and measured approach to Sh\u014dgun provided a fresh perspective, particularly in Hollywood, where viewers had long grown accustomed to dated and cliche portrayals of Japanese culture.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA historically accurate, clinically executed portrayal of life in feudal-era Japan, replete with all the requisite costuming wins, exquisite surrounds, and architectural marvels. Beyond aesthetics, Sanada\u2019s expert guidance proved pivotal to the success of the series in more ways than one. The actors spoke ancient Japanese, comparable to Shakespearean English; likewise, the team paid special care to the rituals and mannerisms that continue to pervade Japanese culture today, imbuing the series with an incomparable layer of authentic story line that would not be possible with a traditional Hollywood executive at the helm.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thread of thought pervades every scene, palpable within the masterful production of Sh\u014dgun: There is no doubt in one\u2019s mind that the show was lovingly made by those who bear a deep respect for Japanese heritage. With verity suffusing every scene, the success of Sh\u014dgun is owed to the respectful handling of its source material, indicating that much research and thought had gone into its creation.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSh\u014dgun's success at the September 2024 Emmy Awards is a clear indication that viewers have shifted away from traditional Hollywood. But it isn\u2019t the only drama series to have created a stir in recent days by being genuine.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Bollywood luminary Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s limited series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar made waves across the globe when it premiered on Netflix. Bhansali, who is well known for his no-holds-barred, maximalist productions \u2014 Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) and Devdas (2002), among others \u2014 did not disappoint. Leaning into his propensity for grandeur and beauty, Bhansali infused the eight-episode miniseries with his trademark touch, turning it into a cinematic masterpiece emblematic of the luxury and resplendence enjoyed by the tawaifs of 1940s British India.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile inspired by true events, Heeramandi\u2019s storyline is largely fictional. Visually, however, the show paints a very vivid imagery of life in pre-independence Lahore. Adding onto the exquisitely built sets for which he is renowned, Bhansali reaffirmed his dedication to authenticity by commissioning over 10,000 pieces of Mughal jewellery from Vinay and Anshu Gupta\u00a0at Shri Paramani Jewels. He then guided the three-year-long process from design to completion, ensuring the resultant splendour would reflect his vision of India.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all, the completed treasure hoard came up to 300 kilos in weight, an\u00a0extraordinary showcase of Indian culture and heritage.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as Sanada banked on an authentic story line to guarantee the success of Sh\u014dgun, so too did Bhansali safeguard Heeramandi\u2019s triumph. The show went on to become the most-watched Bollywood production on Netflix, garnering 4.5 million views on its debut week. It also became the second most-watched non-English series and trended in 43 countries.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June, following its global success, Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar was renewed for a second season.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bear: When television feels real\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSetting aside historical and cultural accuracy, viewers have also been drawn to authentic portrayals of human nature. Gone are the days of the infallible superhero. As humanity continues to grow beyond the fledgling stages of acceptance for imperfections, television has introduced a brand-new host of characters to identify with, and root for.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImperfections have become the currency of character creation and world-building, with flawed leads becoming the norm. In The Bear, which does not shy away from the grittier aspects of humanity, authenticity manifests in the very real, and very human flaws that haunt the footsteps of each character.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepressed and in denial, Carmen \u2018Carmy\u2019 Berzatto (portrayed by Jeremy Allen White) grapples with obsession.\u00a0Plagued by scenes from an unhappy childhood and a tumultuous relationship with her mother, Natalie \u2018Sugar\u2019 Berzatto (portrayed by Abby Elliott) struggles on the brink of motherhood. Richard Richie\u2019 Jerimovich (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) flounders to find his purpose. Tina Marrero (Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas) attempts to find her place in a world that appears to have left her behind. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in each and every one of these characters, we see ourselves and our struggles manifest. Insofar as The Bear is concerned, authenticity lies in storylines that reflect the world as we live in it today. One could even argue that this is The Bear\u2019s strongest suit \u2014 not discounting the fact that White engaged method acting by attending\u00a0cooking school and training at Michelin-starred restaurants to prepare for the role.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut oh, how we ate it all up.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are audiences trending towards authenticity?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo why have we, as an audience, trended in this direction? The subject of representation is not a new notion in Hollywood; far from it, in fact. With conversations surrounding representation for humanity's many distinctions having suffused Hollywood for decades now, it was only in recent years that we began seeing the fruits of our forebears' labours.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current iteration of diversity began with Marvel's Black Panther, a masterpiece that depicted the fictional Wakandans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0of African heritage\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as technologically driven, forward-thinking people, eschewing Western media's typical portrayal of the same.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, while it is a fact that audiences want to see diversity on their screens, diversity for diversity's sake alone has largely proven ineffectual in garnering success. Take, for example, Jada Pinkett Smith's historical Netflix documentary Queen Cleopatra (2023), which featured black actress Adele James in the titular role of the iconic Egyptian royal. Of note: Cleopatra is widely regarded by scholars as having\u00a0Macedonian Greek ancestry.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bulk of historians overwhelmingly support this claim, with even Egypt suing Netflix to dispute the show's depiction of their ancient queen.\u00a0On Rotten Tomatoes, the series received a dismal score of 18 per cent; it was likewise rubbished on IMDb, where it received a score of 1.2\/10.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short: Gone are the days of representation for representation\u2019s sake, where filmmakers relied on token characters to widen their berth for appealing to diverse audiences. In the case of Bridgerton, an incredibly diverse cast of characters come together to realise the Shondaland vision of diversity; and it largely succeeds, relying not on the tokenism of casting non-white actors, but on the quality of its storytelling and its heavy reliance on \u2018aspirational accuracy\u2019. Much like Sh\u014dgun and Heeramandi, Bridgerton\u2019s decisiveness in casting inclusively feels genuine \u2014 an honest endeavour towards progressiveness as opposed to a transparent attempt to be labelled as such.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Sh\u014dgun's groundbreaking success at the Emmy Awards are anything to go by, it is that authenticity will never go out of style. And in the ever-turning Hollywood hamster wheel of content, showrunners and producers would do well to look to these peers for inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSh\u014dgun and The Bear are now streaming on Disney+.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar is streaming on Netflix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story first appeared here.\r\n\r\n "},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Woo Do-hwan gets candid about his character and chemistry with co-stars in \u2018Mr. Plankton\u2019","position":30,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/mr-plankton-star-woo-do-hwan-interview\/","description":"\u201cI want to live,\u201d is one of the first and last lines that actor Woo Do-hwan says in Mr. Plankton. It\u2019s a delivery filled with earnest emotions that truly lured in viewers. But in some ways, it\u2019s also a showcase of the actor\u2019s acting prowess. Now, the world is tuned in. If they didn\u2019t know Woo Do-hwan, they do now. And they\u2019re seated for more. In our interview with Woo Do-hwan, he takes us behind the scenes of filming the Netflix series and gives more insights into his character.\r\n\r\nTaking on the role of Heo-jo is the latest addition to the actor\u2019s colourful portfolio. His versatility has been eye-catching from the get-go: with the scene-stealer Seok Dong-cheol in Save Me, the charismatic Kim Min-joon in Mad Dog, and the dual nature of Jo-young and Jo Eun-sup in The King: Eternal Monarch. Beyond Woo Do-hwan\u2019s emotional Korean dramas, his acting chops extend to saeguk and action as seen in My Country: The New Age and Bloodhounds. And, most recently, the 32-year-old star accepted the challenge of portraying a terminally ill character, Hae-jo (his chosen name)\/Chae Seung-hyeok (his birth name). The character\u2019s bold nature and sort of \u201ctsundere\u201d persona stretch his acting abilities. It\u2019s a test to see how the actor can balance the toughness yet carefree nature of the role. But he has certainly made his case and praises have come for his incredible performance.\r\n\r\nFollowing Mr. Plankton\u2019s premiere on Netflix and riding on the acclaim he\u2019s receiving, Lifestyle Asia Hong Kong got to sit down with Woo Do-hwan for an interview. It\u2019s a conversation without the flashy cameras and jam-packed conference room. Just like the free-spirited Hae-jo, the heartthrob gets candid, taking us through the complex DNA of his character. He also touches upon his natural chemistry with his co-stars and his newfound appreciation for the beauty of South Korea, and gives a heartfelt message to his character. Find out more in our interview with Woo Do-hwan below.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282748\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Woo Do-hwan spills the beans on his experience filming Mr. Plankton. Image credit: Jiyeon Kim\/Netflix[\/caption]\r\nWoo Do-hwan gives insights into his character in Mr. Plankton \u00a0\r\nWhat attracted you to the project and made you want to be a part of it?\r\nI loved the message that the show embodied and I wanted to share that message with a wider audience.\u00a0 I think Hae-jo\u2019s free-spirited side was something that I've always wanted to express and try out.\r\nIn terms of playing Hae-jo, what are some aspects that you focused on and want the viewers to take note of?\r\nI want viewers to look out for how he really doesn't care about what other people think. He really likes to lay it bare and has no problem adapting to the situation. Sometimes, the way he speaks can come off as tough and makes him seem like a self-centred person. But I just want people to recognise that he's on this journey of personal growth.\r\nIn your previous role for another Netflix show, you had to work out and be on a diet. Were there any similar preparations for this drama?\r\nI didn't really work out this time since my character is terminally ill. So to me, it seemed like he would skip meals very easily so it made sense to keep him skinny.\r\nWhat about in terms of the dramatic scenes? Did you have to prepare anything to portray the emotions of a terminally ill person?\r\nI wanted to show how his condition was worsening as the show progressed. But at the same time, his condition is not something that exists in real life. It's not an official illness. So, I just wanted to portray a character that was heading to the end of his life. But I didn't want to depict him in the stereotypical way that we often see. Instead, I expressed it in a way that his body wasn't really moving or acting in the way that he would tell it to act.\r\n\r\n[gallery size=\"full\" columns=\"2\" ids=\"5282744,5282745\"]\r\nWhat was it like working with your cast members to build your chemistry?\r\nAll three of us \u2014 Lee Yoo-mi, Oh Jung-se, and myself \u2014 met up in advance. We did table reads before filming began and spent a lot of time together so that we could get close. Plus, we all shared the same love for the show, like everybody was so equally hooked and involved. So, naturally, we got really close just talking about the series.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Yoo-mi, since we were playing lovers in the show, we really wanted to express the chemistry that we had. Luckily, we had natural chemistry on set so everything worked perfectly. In general, the chemistry among the cast couldn\u2019t been better. We really got along at a deep level to the extent that we would understand what the other person was thinking without them having to say it out loud.\r\nYou previously said that the most enjoyable moment in acting is the spontaneity on set. Were there any moments during the filming of this series that you felt that?\r\nYes, definitely, there were a lot of those moments. It was especially true in the scenes with Yoo-mi this time around. We didn\u2019t really want to stick to the lines in the script so we improvised a lot and went with the flow. Also, since this show is like a road trip, there were a lot of montage scenes so we left it up to how things would turn out or unfold on set. It was an exciting experience to have.\r\nSpeaking of road trips, the drama takes viewers through various locations in South Korea. What were some of the memorable locations for you? Did you get a newfound appreciation for the beauty of the country?\r\nWhile we were filming, I was able to learn how we had such beautiful four seasons in South Korea. That was one of the best parts of the filming experience especially when there was the rice paddy scene in episode two. There were scenes on the asphalt where you could really feel the heat exuding from the screen. Then, there\u2019s the snowfield scene that we filmed among the mountains and even the ones overlooking the ocean on Jeju Island. We had everything from mountains to oceans. So, I was really blown away by the wide variety of seasons and backdrops that we have. And just to add, my favourite backdrop was the snow field at the end.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282747\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Behind the scenes of \u2018Mr. Plankton\u2019 with Woo Do-hwan and director Hong Jong-chan. Image credit: Jiyeon Kim\/Netflix[\/caption]\r\nWhat universal themes in Mr. Plankton will appeal to the audience?\r\nJust like the title, the plankton is a microorganism that is very tiny but the show highlights that they still matter and that they're valuable to the ecosystem. So likewise, I want to send out the message to everyone that no matter how rough life may be for them, they still matter. Life may be lonely but they are still valuable.\r\nWhat message would you, Woo Do-hwan, like to give to Hae-jo?\r\nHe might already know this but I know that he\u2019s going on a search for a family. But he already has one. Instead, he should just look around the people next to him. He also shouldn\u2019t think that he\u2019s alone or that he\u2019s been abandoned by his family because he already has the people who love him the most around him.\r\n\r\nWatch the trailer for Mr. Plankton below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2018Mr. Plankton\u2019 is now streaming exclusively on Netflix."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"\u2018The Buckingham Murders\u2019 ending explained: Unpacking the finale of the murder mystery","position":31,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/movies\/the-buckingham-murders-ending-explained-movie-kareena-kapoor-murder-mystery\/","description":"Hansal Mehta\u2019s The Buckingham Murders movie is a murder mystery with elements of a gritty crime thriller.

He is of course guilt-ridden, but Jasmeet is not ready to forgive. In fact, she has refused to move on at all and still possesses the blood-stained shirt of her dead child. To probably take the first step towards overcoming her grief, she gets herself transferred to another town and instantly gets saddled with the case of a murdered child. She just cannot catch a break, huh?\r\n\r\nThe son of Daljeet and his wife Preeti (Sandhu), the victim was called Ishpreet and was adopted by the couple from India. Jasmeet is not the lead investigator in the case and the person who is in charge, Hardik Patel (Tandon) sees her as an intrusion. Jasmeet has misgivings about the case and how it is being handled but her boss, simply called Miller (Allen), will have none of it.\r\n\r\nAs they search for the child (it is a missing person's case before it becomes a murder case) they look for his whereabouts through CCTV cameras. They learn he got off his school bus for a certain park and did not exit. So dead or alive, he must be in there. He is eventually found, dead, on the shotgun seat of a seemingly-abandoned car.\r\nWho are the prime suspects in Ishpreet's murder?\r\nRight from the beginning, Jasmeet notices that there is something off with this case. The car is traced to two Muslim teenagers, Naved (Rahul Sidhu) and Saquib (Kapil Redekar). During interrogation, Saquib is not very forthcoming, but Naved readily confesses it was Saquib who killed Ishpreet by holding his head underwater until he suffocated to death. Nobody is happier about this development than Hardik who appears to carry some kind of grudge against both or either of them. We learn that the teenagers had something to do with the current condition of his sister, for she is in a coma. Miller is happy that the case is, ostensibly, solved but worries that it might ignite communal tensions \u00e0 la 2022 unrest in Leicester.\r\n\r\nBut Jasmeet smells a rat. She refuses to accept that either of the boys had anything to do with the murder and after assaulting Hardik and getting herself removed from the case, she finds out the truth. Well, not the whole truth. It turns out, that Hardik and a fellow cop found Ishpreet\u2019s body before everyone else and not in the car. They put it in the vehicle so a finger of suspicion would point towards Naved and Saquib. Hardik had told Naved that Saquib would be free soon if he said he killed Ishpreet. That was a lie, but Hardik himself also did not kill Ishpreet. Then who did?\r\nWho, really, murdered Ishpreet, then?\r\nAfter Naved and Saquib are deemed not involved in the murder, Daljeet becomes the prime suspect. He had taken a hefty insurance policy in his son\u2019s name and would gain a carload of money if the boy were to be, er, removed from the equation. He was also abusive with his wife and was having an affair with his son\u2019s piano teacher and we are also told the kid had not been attending his lessons of late.\r\n\r\nBut in the end, it turns out the killer was none other than \u2014 drumrolls, please \u2014 the boy's own mother (well, adoptive mother), Preeti Kohli. The reason? After her marriage, she had been dissatisfied with her life as she was treated like a servant in her own house. When Ishpreet was adopted, against her wishes, mind you, her life became even worse. To add insult to injury, her husband was cheating on her while all she had in life was her home and chores.\r\n\r\nThe twist is both surprising and once you look at the whole picture, it makes sense. Though, it will pull the rug from beneath you.\r\nThe Buckingham Murders movie brief review\r\nKareena Kapoor Khan, hot off her storming performance in Jaane Jaan (2023), is once again magnetic in this murder mystery movie. She essays the role of a grieving mother with exceptional restraint, only now and then allowing herself to erupt in rage. It is a compelling performance in a movie that gives her time and space to shine. She was not kidding when she said, according to Variety, that she was inspired by Kate Winslet\u2019s performance in Mare of Easttown.\r\n\r\nHansal Mehta\u2019s direction is taut and maintains a steady tension throughout. The script, by Aseem Arrora, Raghav Raj Kakker and Kashyap Kapoor, gives a deliberate, though not exactly slow burn, pacing that gives a lot of complexity and depth to the characters and plot. Ranveer Brar, though not a professional actor, is also pretty impressive in the role, giving a full-bodied performance.\r\nThe Buckingham Murders movie trailer\r\nHere is the trailer for The Buckingham Murders movie.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uSWNCCChrC0\r\n\r\nThe Buckingham Murders is available to watch on Netflix.\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy of IMDb)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"\u2018The Penguin\u2019 ending explained: How the bombshell finale sets up \u2018The Batman\u2019 2","position":32,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/streaming\/the-penguin-ending-explained-colin-farrell-cristin-milioti-batman-2\/","description":"It\u2019s all over. HBO\u2019s The Penguin comic book TV series followed the titular Batman villain and his rise in Gotham City\u2019s dark and treacherous underworld. The finale delivered an explosive, shocking denouement to the tale of Oz that makes me even more excited about The Batman: Part II. This is saying something, as I was already pretty pumped to see Robert Pattinson don the cape and the cowl again. Let\u2019s go through the ending of The Penguin series in some detail, as well as look at the cast, release date, where to watch its episodes and a brief review.\r\n\r\nTo those who do not know, The Penguin series, which ran for 8 gripping episodes, was a spinoff of 2022\u2019s The Batman. Its weekly release schedule greatly helped it build a distinctive fan base that put forward theories about their favourite characters\u2019 eventual fates on social media and other online forums. It created a buzz. Episode 8, titled \"Great or Little Thing\", wraps up Oz\u2019s rise to the very top of Gotham\u2019s underworld and paves the way for a larger conflict in the second Batman movie.\r\n\r\nA gritty and grounded crime drama, the show has rightly drawn comparisons to shows like The Sopranos or a Martin Scorsese mob movie\u00a0for its exploration of Oz (played by Colin Farrell) as a complex and even often sympathetic antihero whose moral, though skewed, set him apart in the criminal underbelly of Gotham. Yet in the final moments, Oz\u2019s actions drive home a harsh truth: he is a villain, through and through, a monster as Sofia Falcone (played by Cristin Milioti) put it succinctly.\r\n\r\nSpoilers alert!\r\nThe Penguin ending explained: Oz\u2019s dark transformation and what it means for Gotham\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282443\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Colin Farrell and Cristin Milioti in The Penguin series. (Image: Courtesy of \u00a9 2024 - Max)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOz Cobb\u2019s journey was described by The Batman's (and its upcoming sequel\u2019s) director Matt Reeves as a twisted take on the American Dream (I am paraphrasing). And after watching the whole season (and probably the show; it likely will not get a second season), I could not agree more. This is indeed the American Dream, only forged in the harsh realities of Gotham\u2019s criminal underworld. Early in the finale, there is another flashback to Oz\u2019s childhood soon after the death of his brothers. It focuses on his strained relationship with his mother Francis Cobb (Deirdre O'Connell) and the trauma that fuelled his ambition. Mocked and underestimated throughout his life, Oz becomes a master manipulator who can fool even himself into believing that he is, in fact, not a monster. He uses the ruthless wisdom passed down from gangsters like Rex Calabrese, who taught him to kill or be killed.\r\n\r\nThe series repeatedly draws on the idea that ambition and sociopathy are often rewarded in Gotham. As Oz builds his empire, he operates with a ruthless pragmatism that sees him betray friends, family, and anyone in his way. That leads him to murder Victor \"Vic\" Aguilar (Rhenzy Feliz), a young boy he took under his wing but got too attached to for his liking. In the end, he sees a connection to his past, his shameful past he wishes to leave behind.\r\nWhat happens in The Penguin\u2019s finale?\r\nThe finale of The Penguin sees Oswald \"Oz\" Cobb complete his brutal rise to Gotham\u2019s criminal throne in an explosive showdown with his chief rival, Sofia Falcone. Sofia ambushes him and sets up a trial that forces Oz to confront his crimes (of killing his brothers or at least letting them die) in front of his mother. Sofia narrates a weakling baby bird killing its sibling to survive and serves as a not-so-subtle dig at Oz himself. However, Oz is unfazed and refuses to break under her taunts even though his mother admits she has known him all along. He manages to free his mother and breaks free and takes her to a hospital.\r\nA turning point in Gotham\u2019s underworld\r\nSofia makes a final bid to kill Oz by calling her former allies but Oz uses her network\u2019s weaknesses against her. He sows division. He drives her to a dock and appears to kill her. But no, he is even crueller than that. Instead of the quick release of death, Sofia will once again have to inhabit the confines of Arkham Asylum. Now, Oz is the unchallenged criminal crime lord of Gotham, having triumphed through sheer manipulation and cunning.\r\n\r\nBut his victory is bitter as he finds his world shifting once more. Turns out, his mother is catatonic from a stroke. His triumph is hollow. The validation that he always sought from his mother, which also caused him to murder his own brothers, is rendered meaningless as she cannot witness it. Though he\u2019s reached the very pinnacle of power, Oz is left with an emptiness. His mother\u2019s final words before her collapse now haunts him. \u201cYou\u2019re a disappointment. You\u2019re a waste of space. I wake up every goddamn day sick that I\u2019m your mother,\u201d she had said. However, he is still the Gotham\u2019s kingpin.\r\nThe breaking of a bond: Oz\u2019s last shred of humanity\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282445\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Rhenzy Feliz as Victor in The Penguin episodes.

As Oz builds his empire, he operates with a ruthless pragmatism that sees him betray friends, family, and anyone in his way. And that eventually leads him to murder Victor \"Vic\" Aguilar (Rhenzy Feliz), a young boy he took under his wing but got too attached to for his liking. In the end, he sees a connection to his past, his shameful past he wishes to leave behind.\r\nGotham awaits: The bat signal lights up the sky\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282447\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Robert Pattinson will be back as the Caped Crusader in The Batman: Part II. (Image: Courtesy of IMDb)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThough Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman doesn\u2019t appear in The Penguin\u00a0episodes (bummer), his presence is teased in the very last shot of the show. As the camera pans across the Gotham skyline, the Bat Signal lights up the night, a warning for those who dare to disturb the city\u2019s fragile order. Oz has solidified his role as Gotham\u2019s newest kingpin, and this quiet acknowledgement of Batman\u2019s presence suggests that their paths will inevitably cross in The Batman: Part II (it\u00a0makes the wait for the DC movie even more painful). The Penguin episodes also cast a new light on the underbelly of Gotham, proving the origin of villains is birthed from trauma, ambition, and tough realities within corrupt city walls.\r\nThe Penguin series\u2019 brief review\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282449\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Despite Colin Farrell absolutely killing it as the titular supervillain, it is Cristin Milioti who is the MVP of this show. (Image: Courtesy of IMDb)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nHBO's The Penguin is a gritty, sprawling dip into the seedy depths of Gotham. Blending crime drama with comic-book darkness in a way that feels freshly sinister, this is as dark a tale as you can get. Colin Farrell gives a tour de force performance as Oswald Cobb, a character as tragic as he is terrifying, shifting from a scrappy underdog to a calculating kingpin. However, as good as he is, Cristin Milioti somehow outdoes him in his own show, bringing a fierce, magnetic and layered intensity to Sofia Falcone that\u2019s hard to shake. She makes Sofia almost a Shakespearean figure \u2014 wounded yet relentless, vulnerable yet vengeful.\r\n\r\nThe Penguin spins a villain's origin story that feels raw and real as the grimy streets of Gotham, largely through twisted family dynamics and power plays, with a shockingly sympathetic antihero arc. This is a rare comic book spinoff that felt more like The Sopranos than Super Friends: dark, compelling, and trading capes and crusaders for crooked deals and ruthless ambition. Also, this series feels very much like an addition that fits nicely into the wider Batman movie franchise. The best part is, The Penguin\u00a0is superb throughout, and none of the episodes fall short.\r\nThe Penguin series cast\r\nApart from Colin Farrell and Cristin Milioti, The Penguin series also features Rhenzy Feliz, Deirdre O\u2019Connell, Clancy Brown, Carmen Ejogo, Michael Zegen, Michael Kelly, Mark Strong and more in the cast.\r\nWhat was the release date of The Penguin?\r\nThe release date of The Penguin was 19 September in the US (20 September in Hong Kong).\r\nWhere to watch The Penguin?\r\nWhile in the US, where it\u2019s available to watch on The Penguin, in India, its home is HBO.\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy of IMDb)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Paul Mescal\u2019s dating history: His romance with Gracie Abrams and past girlfriends","position":33,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/paul-mescal-ex-girlfriends-and-dating-history\/","description":"Quick question: Can a man have no social media presence and still be dubbed as the \u2018internet\u2019s boyfriend\u2019? Well, if you thought the answer was 'no', we implore you to meet the new Hollywood charmer \u2013 Paul Mescal. But who exactly were Paul Mescal\u2019s girlfriends?\r\n\r\nMescal first arrived on our screens in 2020 as Connell in the BBC drama Normal People and soon became the poster boy of romance. \r\n\r\nThe Irish actor has played the lead in some of the most iconic love stories to grace our screens in recent years and has had fans invested in his love life off the screen all along.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile some of his relationships have been public like the one with singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers in 2020, others have been pretty elusive like the one with Hollywood royalty Angelina Jolie. He has also been romantically linked to the Talk To Me actor Sophie Wilde.\r\n\r\nAnd now with Mescal finally making his first public appearance with girlfriend Gracie Abrams at the Gladiator II premiere afterparty,\u00a0 we thought of taking a look at his dating history and tracking down all the women he has been romantically involved with in the past.\r\nBreaking down Paul Mescal\u2019s list of girlfriends and dating history\u00a0\u00a0\r\nHere\u2019s a comprehensive list of Paul Mescal\u2019s girlfriends, from flings to full-blown affairs.\r\n\r\n \tPhoebe Bridgers: 2020-2022\r\n \tAngelina Jolie: January 2023\r\n \tKeelin Moncrieffe: 2023\r\n \tSophie Wilde: 2023-June 2024\r\n \tGracie Abrams: June 2024\r\n\r\nPhoebe Bridgers (2020-2022)\r\nProfession: Singer-songwriter\r\nHow did they meet: Online on X (formerly Twitter)\r\n\r\nphoebe bridgers and paul mescal trading caps is something deeply personal to me pic.twitter.com\/8cyYVusuAg\r\n\u2014 juan (@sandovalitwo) March 27, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first famous relationship of Paul Mescal was with American singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers and it all began in a typical 21st-century fashion on X (formerly Twitter).\r\n\r\nIn December 2019, the All of Us Strangers actor posted a picture of his Spotify wrapped on X,\u00a0which revealed Bridgers as his top artist for the year. While the 'Funeral' singer did not respond to her title of Mescal's #1 artist, she did give Mescal some love for his performance in Normal People.\r\n\r\n\"Finished normal people and now I'm sad and horny oh wait,\" Bridgers tweeted. Pat came in Mescal's reply, \"I'm officially dead.\" Bridgers wrote back, \"nooo don't die you['re] so talented aha.\"\r\n\r\nIn June 2020, Mescal started following Bridgers on Instagram and just two weeks later they caught up\u00a0for a fun Instagram livestream project for Wonderland Magazine,\u00a0where they exchanged flirtatious banter. By this time dating speculations about the two were already rife.\r\n\r\nLater in November 2020, Mescal hinted at a new relationship without naming Phoebe, telling GQ his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d was a \u201clifesaver\u201d during the COVID-19 lockdown.\u00a0\u201cTo have someone to lean on through such a mad, mad time has been invaluable. Really, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without her,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nThe duo then indirectly made it official in December 2020, with Mescal starring in the music video for Phoebe\u2019s track, \u2018Saviour Complex\u2019.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VJlR3pvgLQA\r\n\r\nThe following year, they were spotted together in two separate Instagram posts. The first was captured at the BAFTAs after Paul took home the award for Leading Actor for Normal People. The second showed the couple getting cosy at a costume party amongst a group of friends, while dressed as Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox.\r\n\r\nThen, in November 2021, they made their romance official, with their first public appearance. The pair walked the red carpet at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in California, affectionately posing for photos, with Phoebe even resting her head on Paul\u2019s shoulder for one photo op.\r\n\r\nAnd if there was any doubt that the red carpet appearance signalled the start of an official romantic relationship, Phoebe even playfully Tweeted during the award\u2019s show, writing, \u201cPaul thinks thousand island is called hundred years sauce.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust one month later, they took their relationship to the next level by going Instagram official. Phoebe posted a sweet snap of the two arm-in-arm by the sea. A modern-day declaration of love, if you ask us.\r\n\r\nAnother milestone in this love story was the 2022 Met Gala, which the pair attended together. Paul and Phoebe looked very much in love as they giggled on the famed Met steps, with Paul looking dapper in a tuxedo, and Phoebe in a glamorous beaded gown.\r\n\r\nAround the same time, rumours swirled of a possible engagement.\u00a0Shortly after, however, a new rumour took over: Paul and Phoebe had officially called it quits.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with their lowkey attitude throughout their relationship, neither one of the duo officially confirmed the split. However, in February 2023, Paul got candid with Vanity Fair about the media\u2019s persistent interest in his love life.\u00a0\u201cSometimes I can drown it out and then other times it makes me really mad and upset,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cPeople are going to write and say things because there\u2019s a certain interest with any person who\u2019s in the public eye in how that person lives their life, and who they\u2019re living up with, and what they\u2019re doing and how they\u2019re going about doing it,\u201d he added.\r\nAngelina Jolie (January 2023)\r\nProfession: Actor\r\nHow did they meet: They met for a coffee\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_211722\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1440\"] Picture Credits: Instagram\/Angelina Jolie[\/caption]\r\n\r\nShortly after calling it quits with Bridgers, it seemed Mescal had struck up a new romance with none other than Angeline Jolie.\r\n\r\nThe unlikely pairing was spotted grabbing coffee in London in January 2023, alongside Angelina\u2019s 16-year-old daughter, Shiloh.\r\n\r\nFans were floored when Angelina Jolie, 47, was photographed meeting with Paul Mescal for coffee in London amid his and Phoebe\u2019s breakup rumours.

Ever since their undeniable on-screen chemistry as Connell and Marianne, fans have speculated if there could be more to the friendship of co-stars Paul and Daisy Edgar-Jones.\r\n\r\nBut while there\u2019s no actual proof that Mescal and Edgar-Jones are actually anything more than good friends, it hasn\u2019t stopped fans from speculating over the years.\r\n\r\nAmong the most famous pieces of evidence are pictures from the 2022 Met Gala where, although Mescal is posing with then-partner Phoebe Bridgers, an image from a different angle shows him apparently gazing at Edgar-Jones in the distance.\r\n\r\nIn another instance, Edgar-Jones presented Mescal a BIFA for his role in Aftersun (2022), making for one of the sweetest moments ever to be caught on camera. In the cute video shared to TikTok, the pair can be seen elatedly hugging after Mescal makes his way onto the stage to collect the award. We\u2019re not crying, you are.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent additions to the Mescal and Edgar-Jones rumours took place in September 2023. In a seemingly innocent series of photos posted to Edgar-Jones's Instagram from Milan Fashion Week, fans were quick to hone in on an unassuming detail.\r\n\r\nIn the second snap, which shows Edgar-Jones at a fitting, her phone screen is on display, as well as what looks suspiciously to be an image of Paul Mescal as her screen saver.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, another rom-com moment took place for Mescal as he was seen shyly spotting Edgar-Jones at the Gucci fashion show.\r\n\r\nPaul Mescal spotting Daisy Edgar-Jones at the Gucci fashion show. pic.twitter.com\/Gca2xkaNw5\r\n\u2014 Film Updates (@FilmUpdates) May 13, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n(Header and feature image courtesy: IMDb\/Normal People, Twitter, Instagram\/Aur\u00e9lie Lamach\u00e8re)\r\n\r\nThis story first appeared here."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Diving into the dating history and rumoured relationships of K-pop powerhouse G-Dragon","position":34,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/bigbang-g-dragon-dating-history-and-relationships-blackpink-jennie-kim-go-eun\/","description":"The king of K-pop, BIGBANG leader and controversy's favourite child \u2013 G-Dragon always keeps paparazzi on their toes with his every move.

The K-pop artists were first linked in 2021 following a Dispatch report revealing their relationship status. A year later in May 2022, he unfollowed Jennie on Instagram, promoting breakup rumours. What happened between the two remains unknown.\r\n\r\nHowever, their romance doesn't end here. Earlier in 2024, media reports claimed the two were rekindling the flame. According to rumour mills, the stars got back together in August 2023, and have been dating since. Sightings of the duo in similar attires, sporting matching rings on multiple occasions led fans to believe about the potential reunion. Speculations arose when fans spotted Jennie wearing a scarf in a YouTube vlog earlier this year, a strikingly similar item that G-Dragon wore at a celebrity gathering. Coincidence? Maybe not.\r\n\r\nWhile some netizens are convinced about their romance, others have dismissed it as mere happenstance.\r\nG-Dragon and Kim Go-eun\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by @ggonekim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother recent dating rumour surrounding the artist was his alleged romance with Miss Korea runner-up Kim Go Eun. In July last year, the duo was spotted at a soccer match in Osaka, Japan, leading fans to churn out gossip. Netizens also spotted G-Dragon's friends interacting with Kim on Instagram, signalling that they indeed were a couple.\r\n\r\nHowever, after months of speculation, G-Dragon's agency finally released a statement. According to Soompi, \u00a0a representative of Galaxy Corporation stated, \"G-Dragon and Kim Go Eun are not in a romantic relationship.\"\u00a0 The clarification continued, \"She is merely a\u00a0dongsaeng (younger friend or sibling) that he knows and her social circle overlaps with his.\"\r\nG-Dragon and Kiko Mizuhara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by i_am_kiko (@i_am_kiko)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than a decade ago, G-Dragon found himself at the centre of romance speculations with Japanese model Kiko Mizuhara. The rumours surrounding the two lasted five years, fuelled by glimpses of them hugging or being intimate with each other at several locations, including Paris. After their not-so-private rendezvous, the two apparently decided to part ways and remain friends.\r\nG-Dragon and Taeyeon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by TaeYeon (@taeyeon_ss)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2015, a tabloid portal stated that Girls' Generation's Taeyeon and G-Dragon were in love with each other, adding that Taeyeon reminded the BIGBANG member of his first love. The two allegedly gave hints about their relationship via social media, posting similar content and wearing 'couple shoes', according to Kpopstarz. Soon enough, both their agencies quashed the rumours but fans continued to gossip even in 2016.\r\n\r\nThat's all for the relationships and dating history of G-Dragon.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image credit: xxxibgdrgn\/ Instagram)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"\u2018Citadel: Honey Bunny\u2019 ending explained \u2014 What happens to Honey and Bunny?","position":35,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/streaming\/citadel-honey-bunny-ending-explained-amazon-prime-series\/","description":"Citadel: Honey Bunny is an Indian spinoff and prequel series of the international mothership series Citadel (2023\u2013). Like the original, it pulls you into a high-stakes world of espionage and intrigue. Developed by Sita R. Menon and the Russo brothers (Joe and Anthony Russo) and directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K., better known as Raj & DK, this action-packed series delivers a familiar mix of adrenaline-fuelled stunts, deep-seated secrets and a story that is both explosive and emotional across its six episodes. Here's Citadel: Honey Bunny and its ending explained as well as its cast, trailer, release date and more.\r\n\r\nThe show features Varun Dhawan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu in the lead and titular roles of Honey and Bunny, respectively. It is set across two distinct timelines (one in 1992 and one in 2000) and follows a stuntman called Bunny (Dhawan) who is also secretly an agent of a spy agency and Honey (Prabhu), who is a young actress who wishes to make it big in the film industry but is struggling.\r\n\r\nAlso in the mix is Honey and Bunny\u2019s daughter Nadia (Kashvi Majmundar), who grows into the character of Priyanka Chopra in the original Citadel. Also starring Richard Madden, Stanley Tucci, Lesley Manville, Ashleigh Cummings and others, Citadel introduced the two rival and independent spy agencies, one called Citadel and one called Manticore. While Citadel fights to preserve the safety and security of humanity, Manticore is a criminal syndicate that manipulates events from the shadows. The original series serves as the anchor for all the spinoffs and world-building.\r\nCitadel: Honey Bunny ending explained: Unpacking the twists, turns and emotional highs\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282376\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Varun Dhawan in Citadel: Honey Bunny. (Image: Courtesy of Prime Video)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIf you love fast-paced spy-thriller shows, Citadel: Honey Bunny will be right up your alley. It has everything you would wish for. It is as evocative as it is pulse-pounding, delivering everything from heart-stopping chases to heartfelt moments. It helps that it has a powerhouse supporting cast, including names like the veteran actor Kay Kay Menon (who played Indian Sherlock Holmes in Shekhar Home, released in August), Sikandar Kher and Simran Bagga.\r\n\r\nCitadel: Honey Bunny\u2019s story kicks in motion when Bunny, seeing Honey\u2019s hopelessness, recruits her for a covert mission. What begins as a partnership soon spirals into dangerous webs of deceit and betrayal as their mission gets out of control and both find themselves in a world that is much bigger than themselves.\r\n\r\nFast forward to the year 2000, when Honey is now a single mother with young Nadia, and Bunny, seemingly lost to her past, returns as a hardened agent with secrets of his own. But as enemies close in and past choices catch up to them, Honey and Bunny will have to come back together for the sake of their daughter, pushing them to their breaking point as they fight to survive and for their family.\r\nWhat happens in Citadel: Honey Bunny?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282378\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Samantha Ruth Prabhu in Citadel: Honey Bunny. (Image: Courtesy of Prime Video)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s dig a little deeper into the show\u2019s plot. In Citadel: Honey Bunny, as mentioned earlier, Bunny convinces Honey to help him in a covert mission for his agency along with fellow agents Chacko (Shivankit Singh Parihar) and Ludo (Soham Majumdar). It is a honeytrap mission and Honey, being an actor, does it convincingly even as she suffers a little bit of beating when the mission goes slightly wrong (when the man realises she is not a woman who had an angry public spat with her boyfriend). Even so, she is a natural and appears to enjoy the work.\r\n\r\nThe agency, Bunny works for is called Foundation, which stands in opposition to Citadel, and it is run by Baba (or Vishwa; he goes by many names) played by Menon. To recruit his agents, Baba collects a few boys from an orphanage and trains them in combat and espionage. In return, the boys and the men they become bear unfailing loyalty to Baba and his mission. We see Baba interacting with other men and women like him across the world. And so he may or may not be a member of Manticore\u2019s Indian chapter.\r\n\r\nHis aim is to acquire the Armada, a MacGuffin device that will enable the user to track the movements and communications (pretty much everything about them) of any person and entity in the world.\r\nThe (failed) quest for Armada\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282381\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Kay Kay Menon is as usual superb in Citadel: Honey Bunny. (Image: Courtesy of Prime Video)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nCurrently, before the series\u2019 events, it is in possession of a certain Dr Raghu (Thalaivaasal Vijay) who is in the Serbian capital Belgrade an event and is meeting a man called Pavel (Izudin Bajrovic). Honey is sent to acquire the device by Bunny, who believes she is fit for field jobs. But Honey has a quality that eludes most spies and agents: conscience. She is also not used to unquestionably follow orders. Even before this specific mission, she had had doubts about the Foundation and Baba in particular. Making his misogyny clear, Baba said he did not trust women and barred Honey from field missions at one point. Honey is the only female agent in the agency. She is only part of the agency because Bunny trusts her. In fact, they have fallen in love with each other (which is why Nadia exists).\r\n\r\nAnyhoo, Honey befriends Dr Raghu and dangling authentic South Indian food as a lure in a restaurant that is distinctly not South Indian, she manages to steal the device. However, she falls sick and it turns out, she is pregnant with her and Bunny\u2019s child. It was Raghu who brought her to the hospital and has been caring for her. Oh, and he does not look like a dangerous man involved with this world\u2019s version of the Illuminati as the Foundation suggested.\r\n\r\nHoney defects to Citadel, who she learns are not the bad guys Baba said they were. The Indian chapter is headed by Zooni (Bagga) and her trusty lieutenant Shaan (Kher). Honey believes Zooni will destroy Baba and the Foundation. In a massive shootout between the Citadel and the Foundation, a hotheaded new joinee called KD (Saqib Saleem) shot at Honey. By now, Bunny knew she was pregnant with his baby. So he fired at KD. The shootout resulted in Baba, KD and others being captured by Citadel.\r\nThe birth of a super-spy: Nadia Sinh\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282383\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Priyanka Chopra as Nadia Sinh in the original Citadel. (Image: Courtesy of Prime Video - \u00a9 Amazon Studios\/IMDb)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Honey disappeared from the public eye and is laying low in Nainital. We also learn that she is actually a princess and abandoned her royal heritage to get out of the shadow of her father (who is alluded to be an abuser). Nadia, Honey and Bunny\u2019s child, is a little girl who has already trained in martial arts like karate and knows how to sniff danger. She and her mother, when apart, communicate using pager devices and code words. At 8, Nadia already knows more about spycraft than most of us. However, now KD and others are on the hunt for Nadia.\r\n\r\nRemember I said Honey thought Zooni would destroy the Foundation? She doesn\u2019t. In fact, she turns rogue against Citadel by Baba, who tells her that her husband (and probably Baba\u2019s brother) was also planning to go rogue but was killed by Citadel (and not by Baba, as Zooni mistakenly believed; of course, according to Baba).\r\n\r\nWe learn that Honey still has the Armada, though she hinted that she had handed it to Citadel. But her cynical mind did not fully trust Citadel either and rightly so (read: Zooni\u2019s treachery). When Bunny learns that KD and the Foundation are pursuing Honey, he gets into alert mode and regroups with old pals Chacko and Ludo to find Honey and learn the whole truth from her.\r\nWhat happens in Citadel: Honey Bunny\u2019s ending?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282385\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Saqib Saleem exudes quite menace as KD in the series. (Image: Courtesy of Prime Video)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nEventually, Bunny meets Baba in an orphanage and finds him recruiting a new batch of would-be spies. He appears to give him the Armada but then destroys it, so Baba would not have any reason to harm Honey and his daughter. Baba is crestfallen and still urges KD to back off. However, KD is his own man now and accuses Baba of going weak. He makes his efforts to find Honey and Bunny more urgent. He gets into Chacko\u2019s home, pretending to be his wife as one of his friends. We do not learn about their final fate, but knowing KD\u2019s ruthlessness, it is safe to assume they are dead.\r\n\r\nIn the final episode, KD and his men attack Honey\u2019s ancestral palace. A few excellently choreographed hallway fights ensue in which Honey and Bunny, finally fighting together as a team, finish off dozens of KD\u2019s men. But Honey is shot in the belly, though she valiantly kills her assailant.\r\n\r\nThe fight is a chase where KD and his men pursue Honey, Bunny and Nadia. In the end, Bunny decides to stop and fight, giving Honey and Nadia enough time to get away. Bunny makes short work of KD\u2019s men but KD himself is his match. They shoot each other and as they lie almost incapacitated, they discuss how they both defied Baba in different ways. Bunny informs KD about Baba\u2019s cooking methods and deliberately burning chicken to test his pupils. Even his supposed \u201cwife\u201d which his charges called Maa was not his wife at all. In fact, they were different women. Bunny ruminates that it is likely KD met a different woman than him. And he is right. In the final scene, Bunny reaches his wife and child and looks at them. It is not clear whether he survives his wounds or not. This is another of the series\u2019 loose ends that will hopefully be resolved in a potential season 2.\r\nCitadel: Honey Bunny series review\r\nCitadel: Honey Bunny is fast-moving and a true-blue spy suspense thriller that has all the intensity and adrenaline expected from such an action-packed series. There is little to no fat in the script, as the show puts everything into every scene for a tightly woven plot filled with plans within plans. Thanks to Raj & DK\u2019s superb direction, the show truly absorbs the glamour of espionage, descending into the perilous double lives of its leads as they fight competing agencies and wrestle with betrayals and other spycraft genre staples.\r\n\r\nAction scenes in the show are phenomenal, particularly during the climax when all hell broke loose during an excellently choreographed hallway fight scene. Though derivative, there are one-shot scenes that impress. Bunny's finale showdown with his and Honey\u2019s enemies combined with Honey's fierce dedication to protecting their daughter, Nadia, leads to a satisfying finale. There are a few loose ends but Honey Bunny\u2019s season 1 still makes for a thrilling, self-contained story. While Citadel disappointed me and Citadel: Diana made me hopeful about the franchise, Honey Bunny makes me excited about the direction of this overarching story.\r\nCast of Citadel: Honey Bunny\r\nApart from the lead actors Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Varun Dhawan, Citadel: Honey Bunny\u00a0also features Kay Kay Menon, Simran, Sikandar Kher, Saqib Saleem, Soham Majumdar, Shivankit Singh Parihar and Thalaivaasal Vijay in the cast.\r\nCitadel: Honey Bunny\u00a0trailer\r\nHere is a Citadel: Honey Bunny trailer:\r\n\r\n\r\nCitadel: Honey Bunny release date\r\nCitadel: Honey Bunny\u00a0release date was 7 November, 2024.\r\n\r\nWatch Citadel: Honey Bunny on Amazon Prime Video here.\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy of Prime Video)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce: All you wanted to know about their combined net worth","position":36,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-net-worth\/","description":"Global pop icon Taylor Swift and NFL\u2019s charismatic tight end Travis Kelce make the ultimate power couple that the world has seen in a while and their combined net worth is proof of their incredible brand value as a unit.\r\n\r\nSwift and Kelce broke the internet in September 2023 when they confirmed their romance as the songstress watched the Kansas City Chiefs play the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri. Since then the two have taken over the world. With their combined net worth estimated to be over a staggering billion, this dynamic duo is redefining the concept of entertainer-meets-athlete couple goals.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYes, when there\u2019s a romantic crossover of a music legend with a star football player, magic happens \u2013 and so do massive paychecks.

Her ongoing The Eras Tour has become a global phenomenon, with sold-out shows lighting up stadiums across the US, Europe, and Asia. The excitement from her fans, the Swifties, has turned each concert into a massive success, contributing to her incredible net worth. By October 2023, she officially became a self-made billionaire and the richest female musician in the world as of 2024.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Travis Kelce, a three-time Super Bowl champion, has built a significant fortune himself. As of 2024, Swift's net worth, according to Forbes, has soared to a whopping USD 1.6 billion thanks to chart-topping albums, sold-out tours and savvy business ventures. Meanwhile, Kelce's successful NFL career and charming persona have landed him lucrative endorsement deals and broadcasting contracts, bringing his net worth to USD 90 million.\r\n\r\nSo, Taylor Swift and Tavis Kelce's combined net worth as of 2024 is estimated to be USD 1.59 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTravis Kelce\u2019s earnings and salary in 2024\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282228\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"645\"] Image: Courtesy Travis Kelce\/@killatrav via Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\nA major chunk of Travis Kelce's net worth comes from his career as a National Football League player. Over his first decade in the NFL, he racked up nearly USD 80 million in salary. Back in 2013, he signed a four-year contract worth USD 3.12 million with The Kansas City Chiefs, and then in 2016, he extended that deal for five more years at USD 46 million. That extension included USD 22 million guaranteed, averaging out to about USD 14 million a year.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFast forward to late April 2024, and Kelce inked a two-year extension with the Chiefs for USD 34.25 million. This new deal averages USD 17.125 million annually and will push his career earnings past the USD 100 million mark when his contract gets over in late 2025.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEven if he decides to retire early, his impressive career has already made him one of the richest tight ends in NFL history.\r\n\r\nLooking specifically at 2024, Kelce's base salary is USD 5,750,000. Additionally, he\u2019s got a USD 11,000,000 roster bonus and a USD 250,000 workout bonus, bringing his total average salary for the year to USD 17,125,000.\r\n\r\nAs Kelce, continues to shine in the NFL, his net worth is likely to keep climbing, but he might need to negotiate a better deal with the Chiefs to see that growth. And the tight end is aware. \"My managers and agents love to tell me how underpaid I am,\" Kelce told Vanity Fair, adding, \u201cAny time I talk about wanting more money, they\u2019re just like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go to the Chiefs and ask them?'\" However, Kelce has his own reasons for not asking the Chiefs for a raise. He doesn't want to leave Kansas City for some extra money, which is something that a few of his teammates have done in recent seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor Swift\u2019s earnings in 2024 \r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282230\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Taylor Swift performing at The Eras Tour. Image: Courtesy Taylor Swift\/@taylorswift13 via X[\/caption]\r\n\r\nKelce has built up a pretty massive net worth and career earnings, but Swift doesn\u2019t have a set salary, and her income can vary a lot depending on whether she\u2019s dropping a new album, on tour or involved in other projects. However, her boyfriend\u2019s earnings pale in front of her.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCelebrity Net Worth (CNW) suggests she rakes in around USD 150 million annually, which is probably more than Kelce will earn throughout his entire time with the Chiefs.\u00a0Forbes also reported that Swift made about USD 92 million in 2022, showing that her earnings fluctuate significantly from year to year compared to Kelce\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThe \"Fortnight\" singer's rising wealth has increased considerably following the success of the first leg of her The Eras Tour, which resulted in USD 190 million in profit for her after taxes. She earned around USD 13.6 million per concert and with over 150 concerts worldwide, the tour is expected to generate more than USD 2 billion in ticket sales alone, according to a 2023 Forbes report.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert movie also broke box-office records and the singer dominated music charts and streaming platforms with her multitude of releases.\r\n\r\nSwift has made most of her envious fortune through her successful career as a country and pop artist. She\u2019s sold over 100 million records globally and holds the title of the most-streamed female artist on Spotify in 2023, with over 26.1 billion streams. Her stadium tour tickets and merchandise fly off the shelves, adding to her wealth. Additionally, her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, went on to become the best-selling album of 2024 within 48 hours of its release in April. It became the fastest album to surpass 1 billion global album streams in history.\r\nThe \u2018Taylor Effect\u2019 on Kelce\u2019s net worth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time Swift went public with the tight end on 24 September 2023 to 22 January 2024, she generated a whopping USD 331.5 million in brand value for the Chiefs. This phenomenon, popularly dubbed as \"The Taylor Swift Effect\" by entrepreneur and investor Joe Pompliano, led to a 400 per cent increase in Travis\u2019 No. 87 jersey sales, via the Fanatics network of sites, including NFLShop.com. Some reports even indicate that this effect resulted in a 20 per cent boost in sponsorships, as noted by The Wrap.\r\n\r\nThe NFL's TV ratings saw a massive spike as well, particularly among women. They recorded the highest regular-season viewership from female fans, with a 53 per cent increase among teenage girls and over 2 million women of all ages tuning in since Swift started attending games, as reported by Reuters via CBC. This surge means more advertising opportunities both on TV and in stadiums.\r\n\r\nCurrently in her mid-30s and still at the peak of her fame, Swift is likely to keep climbing up in her career. At present, her music catalogue is valued at around USD 500 million, and that number is expected to grow as she continues to re-record her earlier albums to gain control of their masters and release new music.\r\n\r\n\r\nTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift\u2019s brand endorsements and merch sales\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282232\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Jason and Travis Kelce (Image: Courtesy Travis Kelce\/@killatrav via Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nKelce earns USD 5 million annually from partnerships with McDonald's, Nike, Papa John's, Bud Light, State Farm, and others. In 2023, he appeared in more commercials for DirecTV, State Farm and Pfizer.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the Kelce brothers launched a weekly podcast called \u2018New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce\u2019 which has seen immense popularity in just two years. In August 2024, they signed a 3-year, USD 100 million deal with Amazon's Wondery podcast service, which has further contributed to the spike in Kelce\u2019s net worth, according to CNW. Interestingly, according to Spotify, inquiries for \u201cTravis Kelce\u201d saw a rise by more than 1,300 per cent on the streaming service after Swift attended one of the Chiefs games initially.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to social media, Kelce has 6.8 million followers on Instagram, while Swift has a staggering 283 million. Although these figures aren't directly comparable, the tight end might benefit more from his Instagram presence through ads, as he engages in several brand endorsements.

Directed by Brad Furman and written by his mother Ellen Brown Furman, the film is based on the eponymous autobiography by Robert Mazur. It also features Diane Kruger, Benjamin Bratt, John Leguizamo, Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui, and more. It recounts his undercover mission to infiltrate drug kingpin Pablo Escobar\u2019s cartel. Cranston, who is no stranger to the fictional world of drugs, played the part flawlessly.\r\n\r\nThe critics received the film positively but failed to attract large footfalls in theatres. It ended up earning over USD 22 million against a budget of around USD 45 million. The movie was released on Netflix on 1 November 2024.\r\n\r\nAlthough the film comprehensively covers the thrilling secret life of Robert Mazur, it is just as thrilling to read the real-life events and details of the major operation. Let's explore the thrilling true story behind Bryan Cranston's The Infiltrator.\r\nUnravelling the true story behind Bryan Cranston's movie The Infiltrator\r\nWho is Robert Mazur?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282189\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Image: Courtesy The Infiltrator\/ IMDb[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMazur is a court-certified expert in money laundering-related matters in both the U.S. and Canada who has worked as a federal agent for the last 27 years. He worked as a special agent at Customs as well as with the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) for 11 years. He also had experience working with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). He was undercover as a money launderer within Pablo Escobar\u2019s Medellin Cartel. He is the president of KYC Solutions and an author.\r\n\r\nMazur wrote a memoir titled The Infiltrator: My Secret Life Inside the Dirty Banks Behind Pablo Escobar\u2019s Medellin Cartel. The book was published in 2009 and is a must-read for anyone who wants to get into the nitty-gritty of the mafia world. He also wrote The Betrayal, a memoir about his 2-year undercover infiltration of the Cali Cartel and underworld figures in Panama. Mazur also served as the Executive Producer of The Infiltrator.\r\n\r\nIn his op-ed in Tampa Bay Times, Robert Mazur revealed that he battled prostate cancer. He extended a helping hand to anyone dealing with similar medical issues. They can reach him through his website, RobertMazur.com.\r\nExploring Robert Mazur's 2-year undercover mission that inspired The Infiltrator movie\r\nMazur's brainchild, Operation C-Chase, led to one of the biggest busts against Escobar's Medellin Cartel in the 1980s. It exposed a tab of over USD 500 million that was paid by the deadly Colombian drug organization. Along with a female agent posing as his fianc\u00e9e, Mazur was able to become a trusted person within the South American drug cartels and the international banking community, successfully carrying out his plan to bust them. With a state-of-the-art recording device packed in a simple, non-suspicious suitcase, Mazur infiltrated these nefarious circles.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with Gentleman's Journal, Murzo recounted how the initial stages of the operation that would eventually bust the cartel of Pablo Escobar, who at one point was believed to bring in USD 420 million a week by controlling 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5282191\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Image: Courtesy The Infiltrator\/ IMDb[\/caption]\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I used to work with informants, get search warrants and put cases together with historical witnesses. I was put on a task force responsible for identifying the highest-level money launderers for the cartel. we collectively came to the conclusion that the most effective tool we could use would be a long-term undercover approach.\" Given his educational background in administration and finance major along with his experience working in a bank and a brokerage firm, Mazur volunteered to be the undercover agent. He went through two years of intense psychological training to craft his undercover persona, Bob Musella.\r\n\r\nWith the help of various informants planted in the underworld, Musella already built a reputation as a wealthy businessman with criminal tendencies. In the interview, Mazur revealed that over \"200 agents in the US, UK and a few other countries\" were keeping him and his partner, Kathy Ertz, alive. During the mission, Mazur and his partner lived life king-size; from staying in USD 1,000-per-night hotel suites to driving Rolls-Royce convertibles.\r\n\r\nOperation C-Chase culminated into Mazur and Ertz's fake wedding where all the infamous corrupt bankers, money launderers and cartel members were invited. At his fake bachelor party, each of the infamous men was taken in separate limos and promptly arrested.\r\nHere is the trailer of The Infiltrator\u00a0movie\r\n[embed]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N7_M4hjXW1I[\/embed]\r\n\r\n(Hero and feature image: Courtesy The Infiltrator\/ IMDb)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Interesting facts about 'Mr. Plankton' star Woo Do-hwan every fan should know","position":38,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/facts-about-woo-do-hwan-k-drama-career-relationships-childhood-mr-plankton\/","description":"Calling all K-drama fans!

The events of this film highlight the formative years of the 1970s and 1980s in Trump's real estate business and his association with notorious lawyer Roy Cohn which shaped his tactics towards power, publicity, and litigation. It is, at the same time, a character study and a chronicle of Trump's early business decisions, which formed the groundwork for the man who would later become one of the most polarising figures in modern history. Here is everything you need to know about the real story behind The Apprentice (2024) as well as its cast, release date, official trailer and more.\r\n\r\nHelmed by Ali Abbasi, who wrote it with Maren Louise K\u00e4ehne, the film stars Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong (Kendall Roy of HBO\u2019s Succession) as Cohn in lead roles.\r\nThe Apprentice (2024): The real story behind the movie\r\nDonald Trump's early ambitions\r\nAt the start of the 1970s, young Donald Trump, son of real estate tycoon Fred Trump was eager to take his family's business beyond New York City's outer boroughs. While Fred (played by Martin Donovan who you might know from Christopher Nolan films like Memento and Tenet) made his money developing affordable housing projects, Donald wanted to get into Manhattan's high-end real estate market in order to earn himself a reputation as a powerful business leader.\r\n\r\nThis interest in wealth and glory pushed Donald Trump's ambitions further. However, his business practices even then were not free from controversies. In 1973, the US Department of Justice indicted Trump Management, his family's real estate company, for discriminatory practices against African-American tenants. A federal investigation claimed that Trump Management kept black families away from renting apartments while giving preference to white tenants, a case that could have destroyed the family name of the Trumps.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280425\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Sebastian Stan as Donald Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. (Image: Courtesy of \u00a9 Apprentice Productions Ontario Inc. \/ Profile Productions 2 APS \/ Tailored Films Ltd. 2023\/ IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nRoy Cohn: The mentor with ruthless tactics\r\nIt was during this time that a champion emerged for Trump in the form of Roy Cohn, an attorney infamous for the ruthlessness of his methods. Cohn was a man who had been both partially responsible for the infamous espionage case of the Rosenbergs in 1953, for which they were executed, and closely associated with Senator Joseph McCarthy during the purges of anti-Communism in the 1950s (for more, read McCarthyism).\r\n\r\nThis relationship between Trump and Cohn is the central theme of the movie. On-screen, the first scene of their meeting takes place in an exclusive Manhattan restaurant where a frustrated Trump speaks of his frustration with the federal investigation into his family business, which is an accusation by the government. Cohn, sensing the ambition and readiness of Trump to play by the rules and then break them, offers himself as Trump's legal counsellor and coach.\r\n\r\nCohn schooled Trump in approaching challenges with a combative mindset: his three principles were always attack, never retreat, and always stand your ground, even if you have lost. This philosophy became the basis of Trump's public persona. With Cohn, Trump's real estate operations became bolder and bolder. He launched high-profile projects: renovated what was then the Commodore Hotel and is now the Grand Hyatt, and built Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.\r\nThe impact of their relationship\r\nThe partnership of Trump and Cohn was not only professional but a personal alliance based on mutual benefit. Cohn provided Trump with legal protection and political connections to help him secure deals and manage legal issues. In return, Trump opened to him a network of rich influential figures.\r\n\r\nBut Cohn's private life was strewn with scandals, and among them were his disbarment and public outing as a closeted homosexual in the midst of the AIDS epidemic. Even so, Trump publicly broke with him only when the lawyer's influence began to wane \u1173 a step that reminded one of Trump's later modus operandi of casting off those no longer serving his purposes.\r\nThe real events depicted in the film\r\nThe Apprentice opens with the real-life federal lawsuit against Trump Management, a pivotal moment in Donald Trump\u2019s early career. The case was eventually settled without an admission of wrongdoing, but the film depicts how Trump leveraged his connections with Cohn to manage the fallout and maintain his public image.\r\n\r\nAnother significant aspect of the movie is Trump\u2019s ability to use media attention to his advantage. As seen in the film, Trump courted journalists and cultivated an image as a brash, successful entrepreneur, even when his projects were financially risky or legally contentious. This manipulation of media perception became one of Trump\u2019s key tools throughout his career.\r\n\r\nThe film also explores Trump\u2019s personal life, including his marriage to Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova, who rose to fame with 2021\u2019s comedy movie Borat Subsequent Moviefilm). It shows how Trump\u2019s relationships were often transactional, driven by status and appearances. His marriage to Ivana, a Czech model and businesswoman, was an important part of building his public image in the 1980s. There is an extremely disturbing rape scene in the movie.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_5280427\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Maria Bakalova as Ivana, who was Trump's first wife. (Image: Courtesy of \u00a9 Apprentice Productions Ontario Inc. \/ Profile Productions 2 APS \/ Tailored Films Ltd. 2023\/ IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nThemes of power, influence, and control\r\nAt its heart, The Apprentice is not just a Donald Trump biopic and not even a dramatisation of his relationship with Cohn \u2014 it is a commentary on the dynamics of power, influence, and ambition in America. Trump and Cohn embody the idea that success in US politics and business often comes at the cost of integrity and conscience. The film depicts Trump as a product of the 1980s \u2014 this was the time in America when greed, ambition, and personal branding were in and fairness and transparency were out \u2014 so to speak.\r\n\r\nThe movie is also a reflection on how powerful figures like Trump can mobilise their connections, media narratives and legal measures to craft personas that common people can identify with in some sort of way. For instance, while Trump has wealth that would dwarfs most Americans\u2019 imagination, his brash attitude, anti-establishment rhetoric and claims of being a self-made success story resonates with many common people in the country.\r\n\r\nTrump's rise to fame during this period set him up for his future political career, where strategies of media manipulation, attack tactics, and incessant self-promotion would be even more apparent.\r\nThe Apprentice (2024) movie official trailer\r\nWatch The Apprentice (2024) movie's official trailer here:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apprentice movie: Where to watch?\r\nThe Apprentice movie will be released in theatres.\r\nThe Apprentice movie release date\r\nThe Apprentice movie release date in Hong Kong is November 21.\r\nThe Apprentice movie full cast\r\nBesides Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Strong and Martin Donovan, The Apprentice movie features Mark Rendall and Joe Pingue in the cast."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"\u2018Squid Game\u2019 season 2: Take part in the World Premiere Event of the Netflix series","position":40,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/hk\/entertainment\/streaming\/squid-game-season-2-world-premiere-event-netflix\/","description":"It\u2019s playtime for fans of Squid Game, each of whom stands a chance to watch season 2 of the survival thriller horror series at an exclusive screening with the cast and crew of the show.
